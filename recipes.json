    "name": "Strawberry Pepper Icebox Cake",
    "ingredients": "1 cup strawberry preserves, divided\n1 (8-ounce) block cream cheese, softened\n1 cup sour cream\n1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 1/2 cups heavy cream, cold, divided\n1/4 cup powdered sugar\n13 graham crackers\n2 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper, divided",
    "directions": "Line an 8-by-4-by-3-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving enough overhang in each direction to completely cover the top. Measure out 2/3 cup of the strawberry preserves. Set both aside.\n\nBeat the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on high until fluffy, about 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the sour cream and lemon zest and beat until combined, about 30 seconds more. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.\n\nSwap the paddle for the whisk and whip 1/2 cup of the cream along with the powdered sugar on medium-high until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Fold into the cream cheese mixture and transfer to a zip-top bag.\n\nCover the bottom of the prepared loaf pan with a layer of graham crackers. Snip the corner of the zip-top bag and pipe in approximately 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the whipped cream mixture and smooth with a spoon or spatula. (It's totally fine to eyeball this; just know you'll end up with 6 cream layers.) Top with about 3 tablespoons of preserves (again, it's fine to eyeball), followed by 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and another layer of whipped cream.\n\nContinue layering — crackers, whipped cream, preserves, pepper, whipped cream, crackers — until you have 4 layers of graham crackers (see Cook's Notes). Fold the excess plastic wrap over the cake and refrigerate 8 hours and up to 24.\n\nWhen ready to serve, whip the remaining 1 cup cream in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium-high until stiff peaks have almost formed. Drop the mixer to low and work in the remaining 1/3 cup strawberry preserves and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Boost the speed back to medium-high until stiff peaks form.\n\nPull back the plastic wrap and invert the cake onto a serving dish. Remove the plastic wrap completely and frost with the strawberry whipped cream. Slice and serve immediately.",

Stir the lime juice into the shrimp, then refrigerate, uncovered and stirring once or twice, until no longer warm, about 15 minutes, but no more than 30 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, heat an 8- or 10-inch skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-high until water flicked onto the surface immediately sizzles and evaporates. Add the Fresno chilies, chipotle chili and garlic; cook, occasionally turning each item, until charred in spots, 7 to 10 minutes. If charring at different rates, transfer each item to a plate when done.\n\nWhen cool enough to handle, stem and seed the chilies. In a blender, combine the charred chilies and garlic, Worcestershire, Maggi, soy sauce and ¼ teaspoon salt. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Stir the puree into the shrimp mixture. Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes, then taste and season with salt.\n\nIn a wide, shallow serving bowl, evenly distribute the onion and cucumber. Using a slotted spoon, arrange the shrimp on top, then pour the sauce over them. Top with the avocado and tomato.",

    "ingredients": "For the Chicken:\n5 tablespoons fresh juice from about 3 lemons\n4 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n4 tablespoons olive oil\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 pounds skinless boneless chicken breast, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch pieces\n4 medium cloves garlic, grated (about 4 teaspoons)\nFor the Tzatziki Sauce:\n1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, cut into 1/4-inch cubes (see notes)\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 medium clove garlic, grated (about 1 teaspoon)\n1 cup Greek yogurt (see notes)\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill\nFor the Salad:\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n6 small tomatoes, cut into wedges\n2 small red onions, sliced thin\n1 medium cucumber, seeded and sliced into thin half moons\n3/4 cup pitted Kalamata olives\n6 ounces crumbled feta\n1/4 cup chopped parsley\n6 pitas",
    "directions": "In a medium bowl, whisk lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Place chicken cubes in a separate medium bowl. Mix in grated garlic and 7 tablespoons of dressing. Toss chicken to coat evenly, cover, and refrigerate to marinate for about 2 hours, tossing occasionally. Set remaining dressing aside for salad.\n\nWhile the chicken marinates, make the tzatziki sauce: Place cubed cucumbers in a strainer set over a bowl. Toss with 1/2 teaspoon salt and let sit to drain, about 30 minutes. Gently pat cucumbers dry with paper towel, place in small bowl, and mix with garlic, yogurt, and dill. Season to taste with salt. Refrigerate until ready to serve.\n\nSkewer chicken pieces on 8 to 12 skewers. Discard used marinade. Heat grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Place chicken skewers on grill (or cook in batches on grill pan) until well browned and internal temperature registers 155°F (68°C) on an instant-read thermometer, turning evenly to cook on all sides, about 5 minutes total. (Adjust temperature of grill if necessary.) Remove chicken to a serving platter and let rest 3 minutes. Meanwhile, briefly grill pitas and keep warm.\n\nJust before serving, prepare the salad: Whisk olive oil into reserved chicken marinade. Add tomatoes, onions, cucumber, olives, feta, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nServe skewers with salad, pita, and tzatziki sauce. Remove chicken from skewers to stuff into pitas with sauce and salad.",

    "directions": "1. Toss 4 tablespoons oil, potatoes, onion, ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper in large bowl until potato slices are thoroughly separated and coated in oil. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Reduce heat to medium-low, add potato mixture to skillet, and set bowl aside without washing. Cover and cook, stirring with rubber spatula every 5 minutes, until potatoes offer no resistance when poked with tip of paring knife, 22 to 28 minutes (it’s OK if some potato slices break into smaller pieces).\n\n2. Meanwhile, whisk eggs and remaining ½ teaspoon salt in reserved bowl until just combined. Using rubber spatula, fold hot potato mixture, red peppers, and peas into eggs until combined, making sure to scrape all potato mixture out of skillet. Return skillet to medium-high heat, add remaining teaspoon oil, and heat until just beginning to smoke. Add egg-potato mixture and cook, shaking pan and folding mixture constantly for 15 seconds. Smooth top of mixture with rubber spatula. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook, gently shaking pan every 30 seconds until bottom is golden brown and top is lightly set, about 2 minutes.\n\n3. Using rubber spatula, loosen tortilla from pan, shaking back and forth until tortilla slides around freely in pan. Following photos below, slide tortilla onto large plate. Invert tortilla onto second large plate and slide it browned-side up back into skillet. Tuck edges of tortilla into skillet with rubber spatula. Return pan to medium heat and continue to cook, gently shaking pan every 30 seconds, until second side is golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Slide tortilla onto cutting board or serving plate and allow to cool at least 15 minutes. Cut tortilla into cubes or wedges and serve with Garlic Mayonnaise, if desired.",

Stir the mayonnaise, cream cheese, Parmesan, lemon juice, thyme, and cayenne into the onion mixture until uniform, smearing any lumps of cream cheese against the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Gently fold in the chopped artichokes and season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the mixture to an ungreased 8-inch square baking dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly over the top.\n\n5. TO STORE: Cover the baking dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\n\n6. TO SERVE: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Unwrap the dip and bake, uncovered, until hot throughout and the bread crumbs are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Right off the bat, we knew we’d need to find a replacement for the tinny-tasting canned artichokes that most roasted artichoke dip recipes use. We liked frozen artichokes, which were passable if boiled, but far better if roasted with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Most artichoke dip recipes specify a 1-1 ratio of mayo to cheese; however, we found this made for a dip with a grainy texture. More mayonnaise remedied that, but the resulting batch lacked the creaminess we wanted. Adding sour cream made the dip’s flavor too tart, but a small amount of cream cheese produced a dip every bit as creamy as we wanted.",

    "directions": "FOR THE CRUST:\nUsing stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour blend, almond flour, psyllium, baking powder, salt, and yeast on low speed until combined. Slowly add warm water and oil in steady stream until incorporated. Increase speed to medium and beat until dough is sticky and uniform, about 6 minutes. (Dough will resemble thick batter.)\n\nRemove bowl from mixer, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand until inside of dough is bubbly (use spoon to peer inside dough), about 1 1/2 hours. (Dough will puff slightly but will not rise.)\n\nAdjust oven racks to middle and lower positions. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and spray liberally with oil spray. Transfer half of dough to center of 1 prepared sheet. Using oil-sprayed rubber spatula, spread dough into 8-inch circle. Spray top of dough with oil spray, cover with large sheet of plastic, and, using your hands, press out dough to 11 1/2-inch round, about 1/4 inch thick, leaving outer 1/4 inch slightly thicker than center; discard plastic. Repeat with remaining dough and second prepared sheet.\n\nPlace prepared sheets in oven and heat oven to 325 degrees. Bake dough until firm to touch, golden brown on underside, and just beginning to brown on top, 45 to 50 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Transfer crusts to wire rack and let cool.\n\n**FOR THE SAUCE: **Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.\n\n**One hour before baking pizza**, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position, set baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees.\n\nTransfer 1 par-baked crust to pizza peel. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce in thin layer over surface of crust, leaving 1/4-inch border around edge. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 1 cup mozzarella. Carefully slide crust onto stone and bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat with second crust, 1/2 cup tomato sauce (you will have extra sauce), remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan, and remaining 1 cup mozzarella.\n\n**TO MAKE AHEAD:** Extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month. Parbaked and cooled crusts can sit at room temperature for up to 4 hours. Completely cooled crusts can be wrapped with plastic wrap and then aluminum foil and frozen for up to 2 weeks. Frozen crusts can be topped and baked as directed without thawing.",

Saute, tossing with a non-metal spatula until evenly and lightly golden brown. Sprinkle lightly with soy sauce, saute briefly to further brown tofu. Remove from skillet, draining and discarding any excess fluid.\n\nRinse and wipe skillet dry, lightly oil and place it over high heat. Allow oil to become very hot and add tofu. Saute tofu, tossing with a non-metal spatula almost constantly until very well browned. Sprinkle with soy sauce to taste. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast to coat tofu cubes and, tossing vigorously, saute for a few seconds and remove from heat. Keep warm in the oven while you finish cooking the veggies.\n\nSAUTEED VEGETABLES\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high to high heat. Add onions and saute until soft and translucent. Add bell pepper and saute for 1 or 2 minutes, until slightly cooked, but still firm. Add zucchini and yellow squash, and saute for another minute or two, until squash is slightly cooked but still firm. Add mushrooms and cook until they give up their water. (note- other veggies of your choice can be substituted; onions are always a good base, and the zucchini and yellow squash go well with the gravy, and so we always use these as a base, but we've also used other bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, and peas with tasty outcomes).\n\n",

Add the squeezed lemon peels and any unsqueezed lemon quarterspieces to a large jar, such as an 8-cup Mason jar, a wide pitcher or even a large bowl.\n\nAdd the sugar to the lemon peel pieces in the jar and, using a wooden spoon or a muddler, muddle together until the sugar has mostly dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. \n\nAdd the lemon juice to the jar, cover and shake vigorously (or stir, if your vessel doesn’t have a lid) to ensure the sugar has fully dissolved. Add the water, then add pickle juice to taste. Shake or stir to mix; then strain using a fine-mesh strainer. (To store, refrigerate up to 3 days.)\n\nTo serve, pour into glasses over plenty of ice. Garnish with a lemon slice and a pickle spear.",

    "notes": "Because conventional lemons are often sprayed with pesticides, this recipe calls for organic lemons. If using conventional lemons, be sure to wash the fruit thoroughly. The size and juiciness of lemons can vary; save any leftover lemon for another use.\n\nWhen choosing pickles for this recipe, look for refrigerated dill-flavored ones like Grillo’s, for brighter flavors. Sweet bread and butter pickles, or other pickles that use too much garlic or other seasonings, might overpower the balance of acidity (lemon), sweetness (sugar) and saltiness (pickle brine). Depending on your pickle choice, you may need to adjust the sugar and lemon ratios.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nThis Italian American dish pairs chicken with sausage and a tangy sauce based on bell peppers, onion, and pickled cherry peppers. We wanted our version to be bright and flavorful, not too briny and certainly not too spicy. We started by tempering the heat of the cherry peppers by removing their seeds. We wanted some extra flavor, so we added just a couple of tablespoons of the vinegary cherry pepper brine. After browning the sausage and chicken, we sautéed the vegetables and then nestled the chicken and sausage in the vegetables to finish cooking in the oven, which kept the chicken skin crispy. A tablespoon of flour and ¾ cup of chicken broth resulted in a sauce with the perfect consistency—thick enough to coat the chicken and sausage without being gloppy.",

    "directions": "1. FOR THE YOGURT-GARLIC SAUCE: Whisk all ingredients together in bowl. Set aside.\n\n2. FOR THE KOFTE: Process pine nuts, garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, coriander, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon in food processor until course paste forms, 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add beef, onion, parsley, mint, and gelatin; knead with your hands until thoroughly combined and mixture feels slightly sticky, about 2 minutes. Divide mixture into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into 5-inch-long cylinder about 1 inch in diameter. Using 8 (12-inch) metal skewers, thread mixture onto skewers, pressing gently to adhere. Transfer skewers to lightly greased baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.\n\n3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Using skewer, poke 12 holes in bottom of disposable pan. Open bottom vent completely and place disposable pan in center of grill. Light large chimney starter filled two-thirds with charcoal briquettes (4 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into disposable pan. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\n3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.\n\n4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place skewers on grill (directly over coals if using charcoal) at 45-degree angle to grate. Cook (covered if using gas), without moving them, until browned and meat easily releases from grill, 4 to 7 minutes. Flip skewers and continue to cook until browned on second side and meat register 160 degrees, about 6 minutes longer. Transfer skewers to large platter and serve, passing yogurt-garlic sauce separately.",

    "description": null,
    "notes": "To make sure that the breasts cook at the same rate, purchase two similarly sized whole breasts (not split breasts) with skins fully intact. Whole chicken breasts weighing about 1 1/2 pounds work best because they require a cooking time long enough to ensure that the skin will brown and crisp nicely. If you do not own a broiler pan, use a roasting pan fitted with a flat wire rack. This recipe can easily be increased by 50 or 100 percent. If you do increase it, just make certain not to crowd the chicken breasts on the broiler pan, which can impede the browning and crisping of the skin.",

    "ingredients": "**Topping**\n2 slices high-quality white sandwich bread, quartered\n2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted\n\n**Dip**\n1 (9-ounce) box frozen artichokes (do not thaw)\n1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry\n2 tablespoons olive oil\nSalt and ground black pepper\n1 medium onion, minced\n2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\n1 cup mayonnaise\n4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature\n4 ounces Gouda, shredded\n1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (about ½ cup)\n2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon\n1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves\nPinch cayenne pepper",
    "directions": "1. FOR THE TOPPING: Pulse the bread in a food processor to coarse crumbs, about 6 pulses. Toss the bread crumbs with the Parmesan and butter; set aside.\n\n2. FOR THE DIP: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil. Toss the artichokes with 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and spread out over the prepared baking sheet. Roast the artichokes, stirring occasionally, until browned at the edges, about 25 minutes. Let the artichokes cool and then chop coarse.\n\n3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just shimmering. Add the onion and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and chopped spinach and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer the onion and spinach mixture to a large bowl and set aside.\n\n4. Stir the mayonnaise, cream cheese, Parmesan, lemon juice, thyme, and cayenne into the onion mixture until uniform, smearing any lumps of cream cheese against the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Gently fold in the chopped artichokes and season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the mixture to an ungreased 8-inch square baking dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly over the top.\n\n5. TO STORE: Cover the baking dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\n\n6. TO SERVE: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Unwrap the dip and bake, uncovered, until hot throughout and the bread crumbs are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.",

We liked frozen artichokes, which were passable if boiled, but far better if roasted with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Most artichoke dip recipes specify a 1-1 ratio of mayo to cheese; however, we found this made for a dip with a grainy texture.

    "directions": "01 Heat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the middle position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack on top. In a small saucepan over medium, melt the butter. Add the garlic and cumin, then cook, swirling the pan, until the seeds sizzle, 60 to 90 seconds. Stir in the paprika, cayenne and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Cook until the spices are fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove from heat and whisk in the cilantro, parsley, sugar and lemon juice; set aside.\n\n02 Using a sharp knife, cut parallel slashes on each chicken leg about 1 inch apart all the way to the bone on both sides of each leg. Season all over with salt, then brush both sides with about half of the butter mixture. Place the chicken skin up on the prepared rack and roast for 10 minutes.\n\n03 Brush the remaining butter mixture onto the surface of the chicken. Continue to roast until well browned and the thickest part of the thigh reaches 175°F, about another 15 minutes.\n\n04 Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and let rest for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro and parsley leaves, then serve with lemon wedges on the side.",
    "description": "This recipe is our weeknight adaptation of djej mechoui, which translates from the Arabic as “grilled chicken.” Made the Moroccan way, the bird is seasoned with spices and herbs, along with smen, or fermented butter, before cooking. For our version, we throw together a simple spice-and-herb infused butter and brush it onto chicken leg quarters that then are roasted in a hot oven. The best way to lightly crush the cumin seeds is with a mortar with a pestle, or you can pulse them in a spice grinder. Either way, be careful not to process them to a powder so they retain their texture. Smoked paprika is a Spanish spice, but it lends rich color along with a flavor evocative of outdoor grilling.",
    "notes": "Don’t be shy about cutting through the skin and meat when slashing the chicken. Make sure to cut all the way to the bone so the seasonings can go deep. The slashes also help speed up the cooking.",

    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to lowest position, set pizza stone on oven rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. In liquid measuring cup, whisk yeast into water to dissolve. In food processor fitted with metal blade, process flours, salt, and sugar until combined, about 5 seconds. With machine running, slowly add liquid through feed tube; continue to process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of workbowl, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. (If after 1 minute dough is sticky and clings to blade, add 1 to 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour and continue processing. If dough appears dry and crumbly, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water and process until dough forms ball.) Divide dough in half and shape into smooth, tight balls (see photo 1, below). Place on floured counter or baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart; cover loosely with plastic wrap coated with nonstick cooking spray and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\n\nIn clean bowl of food processor, process tomatoes until crushed, two or three 1-second pulses. Transfer tomatoes to fine-mesh strainer set over bowl and let drain at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to release liquids. Just before shaping pizza rounds, combine drained tomatoes, sugar, garlic (if using), 1 tablespoon basil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl.\n\nWhen dough balls have doubled in size, dust dough liberally with flour and transfer balls to well-floured work surface. Press one ball into 8-inch disk (photo 2). Using flattened palms, gently stretch disk into 12-inch circle, working along outer edge and giving disk quarter turns (photos 3 and 4). Lightly flour pizza peel; lift edges of dough round to brush off any excess flour, then transfer dough to peel. Spread thin layer of tomato topping (about 1/2 cup) over dough with rubber spatula, leaving 1/2-inch border around edge. Slide onto stone and bake until crust begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove pizza from oven with peel, close oven door, and top pizza with half of cheese chunks, spaced evenly apart. Return pizza to stone and continue cooking until cheese is just melted, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to cutting board; sprinkle with half of remaining basil, 1 teaspoon olive oil, and pinch salt. Slice and serve immediately. Repeat step 3 to shape, top, and bake second pizza.\n\n",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "This recipe requires a pizza stone and a peel. Convection ovens will produce a lighter, crispier pizza, and you will need to reduce the overall cooking time by a minute or two. You can shape the second dough round while the first pizza bakes, but don’t add toppings until just before baking. You can let the dough rise overnight in the refrigerator if you like; place the dough balls on a floured baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap coated with nonstick cooking spray. If using mozzarella packed in brine, pat the cheese cubes dry before placing them on the pizza.",

    "directions": "Place the macaroni in a large saucepan and cover it with salted water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to keep the pasta from sticking.

Toss the cheeses with the cornstarch in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.\n\nWhen the pasta is cooked, drain it and return it to the saucepan. Place over low heat, add the butter, and stir until melted. Add the milk mixture and cheese mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheese is completely melted and the mixture is hot and creamy. Season to taste with salt and more hot sauce.

    "description": "Starting the pasta in cold water works just as well as adding it to already-boiling water but cooks faster and with less energy.\n\nA combination of multiple thickeners and emulsifying agents—cornstarch, evaporated milk, eggs, and American cheese—ensures an extra-gooey texture with real cheese flavor.",
    "notes": "Use a good melting cheese or combination thereof, like American, cheddar, Jack, Fontina, young Swiss, Gruyere, Muenster, young provolone, and/or young Gouda. To reheat the pasta, add a few tablespoons of milk to the pan and cook, stirring gently, over medium-low heat until hot.",

    "ingredients": "Salt and pepper\n4 russet potatoes, unpeeled, each lightly pricked with fork in 6 places\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
    "directions": "Open up the potatoes immediately after removal from the oven in step 3 so steam can escape. Top them as desired, or with one of our toppings.\n\n1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Dissolve 2 tablespoons salt in 1/2 cup water in large bowl. Place potatoes in bowl and toss so exteriors of potatoes are evenly moistened. Transfer potatoes to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and bake until center of largest potato registers 205 degrees, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n\n2. Remove potatoes from oven and brush tops and sides with oil. Return potatoes to oven and continue to bake for 10 minutes.\n\n3. Remove potatoes from oven and, using paring knife, make 2 slits, forming X, in each potato. Using clean dish towel, hold ends and squeeze slightly to push flesh up and out. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nTo produce baked potatoes with an evenly fluffy interior, we figured out their ideal doneness temperature: 205 degrees. Baking them in a hot (450-degree) oven prevents a leathery “pellicle” from forming underneath the peel. To season the skin, we coat the potatoes in salty water before baking; we crisp the skin by painting it with vegetable oil once the potatoes are cooked through and then baking the potatoes for an additional 10 minutes.",

Freeze meat until firm and starting to harden around edges but still pliable, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nPlace half of meat in food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped, 5 to six 1-second pulses. Transfer ground meat to medium bowl and repeat with remaining chunks. Stir 1 tablespoon fish sauce into ground meat and marinate, refrigerated, 15 minutes.\n\nHeat rice in small skillet over medium-high heat; cook, stirring constantly, until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to small bowl and cool 5 minutes. Grind rice with spice grinder, mini food processor, or mortar and pestle until it resembles fine meal, 10 to 30 seconds (you should have about 1 tablespoon rice powder).\n\nBring broth to simmer in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook, stirring frequently, until about half of pork is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon rice powder over pork; continue to cook, stirring constantly, until remaining pork is no longer pink, 1 to 1½ minutes longer. Transfer pork to large bowl; let cool 10 minutes.\n\nAdd remaining 1½ tablespoons fish sauce, remaining 2 teaspoons rice powder, shallots, lime juice, sugar, red pepper flakes, mint, and cilantro to pork; toss to combine. Serve with lettuce leaves.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "We prefer natural pork in this recipe. If using enhanced pork, skip the marinating in step 2 and reduce the amount of fish sauce to 2 tablespoons, adding it all in step 5. Dont skip the toasted rice; its integral to the texture and flavor of the dish. Any style of white rice can be used. Toasted rice powder (kao kua) can also be found in many Asian markets. This dish can be served with sticky rice and steamed vegetables as an entrée. To save time, prepare the other ingredients while the pork is in the freezer.",

    "name": "Moroccan Chicken with Olives and Lemon (Chicken Tagine)",
    "ingredients": "1 1/4 teaspoons sweet paprika\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/4 teaspoon ground coriander\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n3 strips lemon zest (each about 2 inches by 3/4 inch)\n3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, from 1 to 2 lemons\n5 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 5 teaspoons)\n1 whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), cut into 8 pieces (4 breast pieces, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks; wings reserved for another use) and trimmed of excess fat\nSalt and ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 large onion, halved and cut into 1/4-inch slices (about 3 cups)\n1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth\n1 tablespoon honey\n2 medium carrots, peeled and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick coins, very large pieces cut into half-moons (about 2 cups)\n1 cup Greek cracked green olives, pitted and halved\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves",
    "directions": "Bone-in chicken parts can be substituted for the whole chicken. For best results, use four chicken thighs and two chicken breasts, each breast split in half; the dark meat contributes valuable flavor to the broth and should not be omitted. Use a vegetable peeler to remove wide strips of zest from the lemon before juicing it. Make sure to trim any white pith from the zest, as it can impart bitter flavor. If the olives are particularly salty, give them a rinse. Serve with couscous (see related recipe).\n\n1. Combine spices in small bowl and set aside. Mince 1 strip lemon zest; combine with 1 teaspoon minced garlic and mince together until reduced to fine paste; set aside.\n\n2. Season both sides of chicken pieces liberally with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large heavy--bottomed Dutch oven over medium-high heat until beginning to smoke. Brown chicken pieces skin side down in single layer until deep golden, about 5 minutes; using tongs, turn chicken pieces and brown on second side, about 4 minutes more. Transfer chicken to large plate; when cool enough to handle, peel off skin and discard. Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot.\n\n3. Add onion and 2 remaining lemon zest strips to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have browned at edges but still retain shape, 5 to 7 minutes (add 1 tablespoon water if pan gets too dark). Add remaining 4 teaspoons garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spices and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened and very fragrant, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Stir in broth and honey, scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Add thighs and drumsticks, reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 5 minutes.\n\n4. Add carrots and breast pieces (with any accumulated juices) to pot, arranging breast pieces in single layer on top of carrots. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n5. Transfer chicken to plate or bowl and tent with foil. Add olives to pot; increase heat to medium-high and simmer until liquid has thickened slightly and carrots are tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Return chicken to pot and add garlic-zest mixture, cilantro, and lemon juice; stir to combine and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.\n\nTO MAKE AHEAD: The recipe can be prepared through step 4, cooled, and refrigerated for up to 2 days. To serve, gently warm until the chicken is heated through, then proceed with the recipe from step 5.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For the depth and flavor of an authentic tagine in about one hour, we developed a Moroccan chicken recipe that followed our standard braised chicken procedure: browning the skin-on pieces to give the braising liquid deep flavor; removing the chicken from the pot; sautéing onion, strips of lemon zest, garlic, and a spice blend (paprika, cumin, cayenne, ginger, coriander, and cinnamon) in a little oil; adding chicken broth and honey; and finally returning the chicken to the pot.

    "directions": "In a deep 12-inch stainless-steel skillet, melt butter over medium heat, stirring often, until melted, about 2 minutes. Once melted, continue to cook, stirring constantly, just until milk solids separate and sink to the bottom of the skillet and begin to darken, 2 to 3 minutes. (Butter can go from brown to burnt quickly, so keep a close eye on it as you stir it.) Add sage sprigs; cook, stirring constantly, until sage leaves darken and crisp and butter foams and browns, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nQuickly add carrots, apple cider, chicken or vegetable stock, honey, salt, and pepper to brown butter in skillet. Carrots should be almost submerged, if not, add a small amount of stock until they are. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover, reduce heat to medium-high, and continue to boil, vigorously shaking the skillet occasionally, until carrots are a crisp/tender, and still firm in the center, about 8 minutes.\n\nReduce heat to medium, uncover (the liquid should look creamy and still almost cover the carrots) and continue to boil, vigorously stirring and shaking skillet often, until the mixture is reduced to a glaze that coats and clings to the carrots, 12 to 14 minutes. If the sauce begins to break and you see oily, butter-colored specks, add a splash of water (about 2 tablespoons) and return to a vigorous simmer, stirring constantly, until the mixture looks creamy and homogenous again.\n\nRemove from heat and discard sage sprigs. Stir in vinegar and season with salt to taste. Sprinkle with herbs. Serve immediately.",

Meanwhile, fill large bowl with ice water. Drain beans in colander and transfer beans immediately to ice water. When beans no longer feel warm to touch, drain in colander again and dry thoroughly with paper towels.\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons butter in small skillet over medium heat until foaming; add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, fragrant, and just crisp around the edges, about 10 minutes. Set skillet aside.\n\nHeat 1/4 cup water and beans in 12-inch skillet over high heat; cook, tossing frequently, until beans are warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and arrange neatly on warm serving platter.\n\nMeanwhile, return skillet with shallots to high heat, stir in vermouth, and bring to simmer.

    "directions": "For the Soup: Using a broiler with the oven rack in the highest position, in a dry cast iron skillet over high heat, or over an open medium gas flame, char onion and ginger, using tongs to rotate for even charring, until softened and lightly blackened, about 10-12 minutes. Allow to cool, then peel the ginger and discard any heavily blackened parts and set aside.\n\nIn a medium cast iron or stainless steel skillet, toast cloves, star anise, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let cool, then wrap cloves, star anise, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds in muslin and tie off with kitchen twine.\n\nWash all bones, shanks, tendons, and tripe thoroughly in water. Transfer beef leg and neck bones to a stockpot and add just enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high hea, then let boil vigorously for 5 minutes to release foamy impurities.\n\nPour off water, then rinse bones to remove any remaining impurities. Wash stockpot thoroughly.\n\nReturn bones to stockpot along with shank and tendons to stockpot. Add cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, spice pouch, charred onion and ginger, salt, rock sugar, and 4 1/2 quarts (4.3L) water. Bring to a boil over high heat and skim off scum. Reduce heat to low and let simmer gently, uncovered, frequently skimming any scum and fat that floats to surface, for 3 hours.\n\nAdd tripe and simmer for 30 minutes. Add fish sauce and continue to simmer for 30 minutes longer.\n\nRemove shank, tendon, and tripe and shock them in a bowl filled with ice water to retain their texture. Drain and set aside.\n\nRemove broth from heat, then remove neck bones and bones with marrow and reserve for another use (I recommend eating it later as a snack). Let broth stand for 10 minutes to settle any sediment, then carefully strain broth through a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth or muslin, being careful not to pour sediment through; you should have about 12 cups (2.8L) broth.\n\nReturn broth to a large clean pot, then taste and season with additional fish sauce and rock sugar to your liking. Set aside until ready to serve.\n\nTo Assemble and Serve: Slice shank, tendon, and tripe crosswise against the grain into thin slices. Set aside.\n\nArrange Thai basil, sawtooth herbs, bean sprouts, jalapeño slices, and lime wedges on a large plate.\n\nPlace sliced onion, scallion, and cilantro in separate bowls.\n\nCook noodles according to package instructions. Strain and rinse noodles with cold water.\n\nFor each serving, place about 4 ounces (115g) noodles in each bowl. Top with a few pieces of sliced shank, tendon, tripe, meatballs, and raw beef round. Garnish with sliced onion, scallion, and cilantro. Ladle about 1 1/2 cups hot broth into bowls and sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. Serve immediately with garnishes.",

    "notes": "See https://www.seriouseats.com/what-is-culantro for culantro image\nVietnamese meatballs can be found in the refrigerated section at the Asian grocery stores. Freeze leftover meatballs and defrost them in the fridge before cooking.\n\nIt is very difficult to slice beef so thinly at home; your best bet is to ask the butcher to do it for you, or to shop at an Asian grocer where you can find pre-sliced beef. If you do want to try slicing it yourself, freeze the beef until partially frozen (not rock-hard, but quite firm), then slice as thinly as possible with a very sharp slicing knife.",

    "directions": "1. Bring a large stockpot with water to boil over high heat. When it comes to a rolling boil, add the beef bones and boil vigourously for 10 minutes.\n\n2. In the meantime, heat a frying pan on medium-low heat. Add the Vietnamese Pho Spices and toast until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Dump the spices to the empty Crock Pot or slow cooker immediately. Return frying pan to medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil is hot, add the ginger slices and the onion half. Cook until the ginger is browned on both sides and the onion half is nicely browned and softened. Add the ginger and the onion to the Crock Pot or slow cooker.\n\n3. When the bones have been pre-boiled, drain, discard water and rinse bones briefly to clean them. Add the bones to the Crock Pot or slow cooker. Fill the Crock Pot with fresh, clean, cool water to just 1-1/2 inches below surface, add the fish sauce and sugar. Cover and set the Crock Pot or slow cooker to cook on low for 8 hours. Taste and season with additional fish sauce if needed.\n\n4. When you are just about ready to eat, you'll prep the rest of the ingredients for the Pho bowls. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the beef balls and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove the balls, keeping the water boiling and now cook the noodles according to package instructions. If you are using fresh noodles, all they need is a couple of minutes. Drain immediately.\n\n5. Strain the stock with a fine meshed sieve. Discard the solids.\n\n6. Line up 4 large bowls on counter. Distribute the noodles, beef balls and thin steak slices evenly amongst the bowls. Ladle the hot Pho stock into each bowl. The hot stock should cook the thin steak slices. Serve with lime wedges, fresh herbs, chili peppers, Hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot chili sauce at the table.",

Heat butter in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat; when foam subsides, whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until nutty brown and fragrant, about 10 minutes; gradually and vigorously whisk in giblet broth and wine. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and flavorful, about 30 minutes; set aside until turkey is done.\n\n3. While turkey is resting on carving board, spoon out and discard as much fat as possible from roasting pan, then strain drippings into saucepan with gravy, pressing on solids in strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Stir in reserved giblets; return to simmer to heat through. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper; serve with turkey.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For our big turkey recipe, we wanted a Norman Rockwell picture of perfection: crisp, mahogany skin wrapped around tender, moist meat. It was difficult to find a container large enough for brining such a big bird. So we chose either a Butterball or a kosher turkey. Both have been, in essence, brined—the Butterball injected with a saltwater solution and the kosher bird packed in salt during koshering. Initial high heat gave our turkey a crisp skin, while lowering the heat for the remaining cooking time finished it off without drying it out. For such a showpiece, we wouldn’t think of serving store-bought gravy. We had plenty of time while the turkey cooked to prepare our tried-and-true giblet gravy recipe.",

    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Dust work surface with flour and unfold both pieces puff pastry onto work surface. Following illustrations below, form 1 large sheet with border, using beaten egg as directed. Sprinkle Parmesan evenly over shell; using fork, uniformly and thoroughly poke holes in shell. Bake 13 to 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees; continue to bake until golden brown and crisp, 13 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer to wire rack; increase oven temperature to 425 degrees.\n\nWhile shell bakes, place tomato slices in single layer on double layer paper towels and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt; let stand 30 minutes. Place second double layer paper towels on top of tomatoes and press firmly to dry tomatoes. Combine garlic, olive oil, and pinch each salt and pepper in small bowl; set aside.\n\nSprinkle mozzarella evenly over warm (or cool, if made ahead) baked shell. Shingle tomato slices widthwise on top of cheese (about 4 slices per row); brush tomatoes with garlic oil. Bake until shell is deep golden brown and cheese is melted, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool on wire rack 5 minutes, sprinkle with basil, slide onto cutting board or serving platter, cut into pieces, and serve.",
    "description": "Tired of tomato tarts with soggy crusts and long preparation time, we developed a tomato tart recipe that would have a solid bottom crust and great vine-ripened flavor. Our secrets for a great tomato tart recipe? We used a two-step baking method for a flaky yet rigid crust, then \"waterproofed\" it with egg wash and layers of two kinds of cheese. We salted sliced tomatoes for 30 minutes to remove excess juice, then gently pressed them with paper towels. Baking the tart at 425 degrees quickly melted the cheese and preserved the tomatoes' meaty texture.",

    "directions": "If using a whole steak, trim and cut steak crosswise with grain into roughly 3-inch wide sections, then set on large plate and freeze until firm but not frozen solid, about 1 hour. If using pre-sliced steak, skip to chopping instructions in Step 2.\n\nUsing a sharp knife, shave steak as thin as possible on a biased angle against the grain. Mound shaved meat on cutting board and chop coarse with knife, about 5 times for store-bought sliced meat or 10 times for hand-sliced.\n\nHeat an empty 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Add oil to skillet and heat until just smoking. Add meat and onion in an even layer and cook, without stirring, until well browned on one side, 4 to 6 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring frequently to move and pull apart the meat slices until meat and onions are browned and meat is no longer pink, 2 to 4 minutes.\n\nStir in torn provolone cheese, Parmesan cheese (if using), salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and well combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat. Divide mixture into 2 individual portions the length of the rolls. Shingle 2 slices of Provolone cheese over each portion. Cover and let cheese melt, about 1 minute.\n\nCenter rolls, cut sides down, over each portion of meat. Working with one at a time, use a large spatula to scoop under each portion of meat and flip meat into roll to create a filled sandwich. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "- Two options make perfectly thinly sliced beef possible: par freeze a steak to make hand-slicing much easier, or buy very thinly sliced meat from a butcher or Asian market.\n- Cooking the sliced beef with the onions saves time while guaranteeing the onions come out well browned while retaining a bit of bite.\n- Folding and melting a portion of the provolone cheese directly into the cooked steak adds flavor and acts as a binder to hold the thinly sliced meat together in the sandwich while eating.",

    "name": "Cast Iron Pan Pizza",
    "ingredients": "**Dough**\n2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour\n1 teaspoon table salt\n1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast\n1 cup (8 ounces) warm water (105 to 110 degrees)\nVegetable oil spray\n\n**Sauce**\n1 (14.5-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes\n1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil\n1 garlic clove, minced\n¼ teaspoon sugar\n¼ teaspoon table salt\n¼ teaspoon dried oregano\nPinch red pepper flakes\nPizza\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (1 cup)\n7 ounces whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (1¾ cups)",
    "directions": "FOR THE DOUGH: Using wooden spoon or spatula, stir flour, salt, and yeast together in bowl. Add warm water and mix until most of flour is moistened. Using your hands, knead dough in bowl until dough forms sticky ball, about 1 minute. Spray 9-inch pie plate or cake pan with oil spray. Transfer dough to prepared plate and press into 7- to 8-inch disk. Spray top of dough with oil spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.\n\nFOR THE SAUCE: Place tomatoes in fine-mesh strainer and crush with your hands. Drain well, then transfer to food processor. Add oil, garlic, sugar, salt, oregano, and pepper flakes and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)\n\nFOR THE PIZZA: Two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n\nCoat bottom of 12-inch cast-iron skillet with oil. Transfer dough to prepared skillet and use your fingertips to flatten dough until it is ⅛ inch from edge of skillet. Cover tightly with plastic and let rest until slightly puffy, about 1½ hours.\n\nThirty minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Spread ½ cup sauce evenly over top of dough, leaving ½-inch border (save remaining sauce for another use). Sprinkle Monterey Jack evenly over border. Press Monterey Jack into side of skillet, forming ½- to ¾-inch-tall wall. (Not all cheese will stick to side of skillet.) Evenly sprinkle mozzarella over sauce. Bake until cheese at edge of skillet is well browned, 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nTransfer skillet to stovetop and let sit until sizzling stops, about 3 minutes. Run butter knife around rim of skillet to loosen pizza. Using thin metal spatula, gently lift edge of pizza and peek at underside to assess browning. Cook pizza over medium heat until bottom crust is well browned, 2 to 5 minutes (skillet handle will be hot). Using 2 spatulas, transfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Slice and serve.",

Drain excess moisture from meat. Return meat to skillet (discard any liquid in bowl) and add salt and pepper. Heat, stirring constantly, until meat is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, sprinkle with Parmesan, and shingle slices of American cheese over meat. Allow cheeses to melt, about 2 minutes. Using heatproof spatula or wooden spoon, fold melted cheese into meat thoroughly. Divide mixture evenly among toasted rolls. Serve immediately.",

    "ingredients": "1 head garlic (2 to 2 1/2 ounces; 60g)\n1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, divided, plus more for serving\n2 1/4 pounds(1kg) yellow, medium starch potatoes such as Yukon Gold (about eight 5-ounce potatoes), scrubbed\n1/2 cup (120ml) heavy whipping cream, plus for as needed\n2 teaspoons (6g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight\nFreshly ground black pepper, for serving",
    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Remove the outer layer of papery skin from the garlic head, making sure to leave the entire head intact. Slice about 1/4 inch off the tops of the garlic head so the cloves are all exposed. Place garlic head on a piece of aluminum foil large enough to wrap the garlic, and set 1 piece of butter on top of the cut side; enclose it with the foil.\n\nUsing a paring knife, score potato skins lengthwise around the middle of each potato. Arrange potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and cover sheet tightly with aluminum foil. Place wrapped garlic directly on oven rack; Bake potatoes and garlic until potatoes are fork-tender and garlic is deep golden and soft, about 1 hour. Set garlic aside to cool slightly while preparing the potatoes. Let potatoes stand until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.\n\nWhile potatoes are still hot, carefully remove the skins using a paring knife; discard skins. Set a ricer or food mill over a large bowl and pass potatoes through. Alternatively, transfer potatoes to a large bowl and mash with potato masher, being careful not to overwork. Add remaining butter pieces and squeeze roasted garlic cloves (discarding skins) into potatoes; mash mixture with a large fork or potato masher until well combined.\n\nMicrowave heavy cream until steaming, about 30 seconds. Slowly add warm heavy cream and salt, folding into potatoes until creamy and smooth. Adjust consistency with additional warmed heavy cream as needed to desired texture. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, if desired. Serve immediately with pats of butter on top.",

Cool until handleable, then pull the stem(s) off the chile(s) and roughly chop. Peel the skin off the garlic. Scoop into a food processor and pulse until quite finely chopped.\n\nAdd the tomatoes with their juice. Re-cover and pulse until you have a coarse puree. Scrape into a serving dish. Stir in the black olives, cilantro and the fruit (plus any liquid). If necessary, add a little water to give the salsa an easily spoonable consistency. Taste and season with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon. You’re ready to serve.",

    "directions": "01 Heat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. In a large Dutch oven, toss the beef with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Add ½ the carrots, the anchovies, oil, garlic and onion, then toss. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook for 2 hours.\n\n02 Remove the pot from the oven and stir in ½ cup of the olives. Return to the oven uncovered and cook until a knife inserted into a piece of beef meets no resistance, 1 to 1½ hours.\n\n03 Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a large bowl, leaving the vegetables in the pot. Set a fine mesh strainer over a fat separator or medium bowl. Pour the meat juices into the strainer, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids. You should have about 2½ cups liquid; if needed, add water to make up the difference.\n\n04 Pour the wine into the now-empty pot and bring to a boil over medium-high, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the wine is reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, if you strained the meat juices into a bowl, use a spoon to skim off and discard the fat from the surface.\n\n05 Pour the defatted meat juices into the pot and add the remaining carrots and the bell pepper. Return to a simmer and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the orange juice and beef. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce begins to cling to the meat, 3 to 6minutes.\n\n06 Off heat, stir in the remaining ½ cup olives, the orange zest, vinegar and half of the parsley. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley.",

    "notes": "Use a light hand when seasoning with kosher salt, as the cheese itself is rather salty. Cooling the quesadillas before cutting and serving is important; straight from the skillet, the cheese is molten and will ooze out.

Finished quesadillas can be held on a baking sheet in a 200-degree oven for up to 20 minutes",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Roast chicken is often described as a simple dish, and it is, at least in terms of flavor—when the dish is made properly, the rich flavor and juicy meat of the chicken need little adornment. But the actual process of preparing and roasting chicken is anything but simple; recipes often call for complicated trussing techniques and for rotating the bird multiple times during cooking. And the most time-consuming part is salting or brining the bird, a step that ensures juiciness and well-seasoned meat. After systematically testing the various components and steps of a typical recipe, we found we could just tie the legs together and tuck the wings underneath. We also discovered we could skip both the V-rack and flipping the chicken by using a preheated skillet and placing the chicken breast side up; this method gave the thighs a jump-start on cooking. Starting the chicken in a 450-degree oven and then turning the oven off while the chicken finished cooking slowed the evaporation of juices, ensuring moist, tender meat.",

Remove the chicken to a platter, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes while you prepare the sauce, leaving the lemons and onions in the pan.\n\nPlace the pan on top of the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the wine and stir with a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits. Add the stock and sprinkle on the flour, stirring constantly for a minute, until the sauce thickens. Add any juices that collect under the chicken. Carve the chicken onto a platter and serve with the lemons, onions, and warm sauce.",

Transfer to ice bath to chill.\n\nFill a second large bowl with ice water. In the same saucepan, bring 3 quarts (2.8L) water to a boil. Carefully lower eggs in and continue to boil for 30 seconds. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low (water should maintain a bare simmer), and continue cooking for 11 minutes. Immediately place eggs in second bowl of ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling under cool running water.\n\nMeanwhile, in the bowl of a food processor, place mayonnaise, sour cream, basil, dill, lemon juice, mustard, anchovy fillet, pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and process until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in chives and tarragon.\n\nTransfer haricot verts to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry. Cut eggs into quarters and transfer to small plate or bowl and cover and refrigerate until ready to serve salad.\n\nIn a large bowl, combine fennel, potatoes, haricot verts, and green goddess dressing. Stir with rubber spatula to combine. Fold in potatoes. Season with salt to taste. Cover and rest in fridge for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days before serving. To serve, transfer potato salad to serving bowl and decoratively arrange quartered eggs on top. Garnish with basil, dill, and chives.\n\nSerious Eats/ Stacy Allen\n\nThe salad can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Cooked eggs can be stored separately in an airtight container for up to 5 days.",

    "notes": "**TECHNIQUE\n\nThe Benefits of Overcooking Waxy Potatoes**\nThe rules for cooking potatoes seem pretty straightforward: Undercook them and they’ll stay intact; overcook them and they’ll break down into crumbly bits. But while developing our Braised Red Potatoes recipe, we allowed a batch of halved red potatoes to simmer for 35 minutes (by which point I expected them to be overcooked) and noticed that they not only stayed intact but actually cooked up incredibly creamy and smooth. Had we been wrong about the effects of overcooking potatoes in general, or was there something different about the low-starch red kind?\n\n**EXPERIMENT\n**\nWe prepared two batches of my working recipe, one with low-starch red potatoes and another with high-starch russets (quartering these larger spuds) and simmering each for 35 minutes.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nJust as they had before, the red potatoes held their shape and boasted remarkably silky interiors. The russets, however, broke down and turned crumbly and mushy.\n\n**EXPLANATION**\n\nA little-known but key difference between waxy potatoes (red or new potatoes) and starchy potatoes (russets) is that they contain different ratios of two different starches: amylopectin and amylose. Waxy potatoes contain very little amylose; as they cook, the starch granules in waxy potatoes burst, releasing very sticky amylopectin, which in essence glues the potato structure together, giving the impression of creaminess. In a russet or other starchy potato, there is a higher ratio of the second starch—amylose—which is made up of smaller molecules that are less sticky. Despite the fact that, overall, russets contain more starch than do waxy potatoes (hence they are often described as being “high starch”), russets simply fall apart once overcooked since most of the starch is the less sticky amylose.\n\n",

    "directions": "Combine the milk and cornstarch in a medium bowl. Using a fork, whisk until the cornstarch is completely dissolved and no lumps remain. Whisk in the eggs, salt, and dill.\n\nIn a medium nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. When the butter starts to bubble, add the egg mixture. Let it set around the edges, about 30 seconds. Using a rubber spatula, pull the edges inward, letting the runny eggs spill toward the edges of the pan. Let cook for 30 seconds cooking, more, then pull the set edges to the center again. Continue stirring constantly, until the eggs look soft and slightly under-cooked, 60 to 90 seconds more (they will continue to cook, so best not to wait until they are fully cooked to take them off the heat). Remove from the heat and transfer the eggs to a platter. Sprinkle the chives over the top and serve.",

    "directions": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\nAlthough this dish goes together quickly, you can prepare the topping and blanch the cauliflower (steps 1 and 2) an hour or two in advance. Don’t prepare the sauce or bake the gratin until just before serving.\n\n**For the topping:** Pulse bread, butter, salt, and pepper in food processor until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about ten 1-second pulses; set aside.\n\n**For the filling:** Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 450 degrees. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven or stockpot over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt and cauliflower; cook until outsides are tender but insides are still slightly crunchy, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain cauliflower in colander and rinse under cold running tap water until no longer hot. Leave cauliflower in colander to drain.\n\nHeat butter in large skillet over medium heat; when foam subsides, add shallot and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds; stir in flour until combined, about 1 minute. Whisk in cream and bring to boil. Stir in nutmeg, cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper, thyme, and 1/2 cup cheese until incorporated. Off heat, gently stir in cauliflower until evenly combined. Transfer mixture to 11 by 7-inch (2-quart) gratin dish. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons cheese evenly over surface, then sprinkle evenly with bread crumb topping. Bake until golden brown and sauce is bubbling around edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve immediately.",

    "directions": "**FOR THE LEVAIN:** Combine flour, water, and starter in small bowl and stir with wooden spoon until uniform. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit until doubled in volume, 3 to 5 hours. Use immediately or transfer to refrigerator and use within 7 days.\n\n**FOR THE DOUGH:** Whisk flour and salt together in medium bowl. In large bowl, combine water and 57 grams levain (discard remainder), and whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture to water mixture and stir using wooden spoon, scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl until dough comes together, then knead by hand in bowl until shaggy ball forms and no dry flour remains. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until subtly domed, lightly bubbly, and just doubled in volume, 6-12 hours.\n\nTransfer dough to lightly floured counter. Gently press dough into 8- to 10-inch disk, then fold edges toward middle to form round*. Cover loosely with plastic and let rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, line colander or banneton with large linen or cotton dish towel and dust liberally with flour. Repeat pressing and folding of dough to form round, then place dough seam side down on counter and form into tight round.  **Place dough seam side up in floured banneton (or towel in colander)**. Cover top of dough loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour, then refrigerate for 24-36 hours (whatever is most convenient).\n\nOne hour before baking bread, adjust oven rack to middle position, set covered heavy-bottomed Dutch oven on rack, and heat oven to 475 degrees.\n\nOnce oven has preheated for 1 hour, lay 12- by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper on counter and spray generously with vegetable oil spray. Uncover colander, and unfold edges of towel. Lay parchment sprayed side down over loaf, then invert colander onto counter. Remove colander and towel.\n\nCarefully remove Dutch oven from oven, place on stovetop, and set lid aside. Using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 7-inch-long, 1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Pick up dough by lifting parchment edges and lower into Dutch oven. Carefully cover pot and transfer to oven. Bake for 20 minutes.\n\nRemove lid, reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees, and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and registers 210 degrees, 25 to 35 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot; transfer to wire rack and let cool completely before slicing, 2 to 3 hours. (Store uneaten bread cut side down on cutting board for up to 3 days.)",

    "notes": "2025-06-26 - Tried 100 gm of Levain, 350 gm water\n2025-05-10 - Need more tanginess. Dropping first bulk fermentation rise to 6-12 hours from 12-18 (just doubled). Extending the 2nd rise in the fridge from 12-24 to 24-36 hour.\nTry using more levain (about 15% to flour ratio) - adjust 57 g to 77 g levain\nWill also try using **wheat flour** for levain \n\n2025-05-08 - Made. Much easier than expected. \nAdjusting cook time after removing lid from 15 to 30 minutes at 425º. Trust the 210º bread temp. It needed to get that to get to darkness.\n[photo:1]\n\n*To round, set dough on unfloured counter. Loosely cup your hands around dough and, without applying pressure to dough, move your hands in small circular motions. Tackiness of dough against counter and circular motion should work dough into smooth, even ball, but if dough sticks to your hands, lightly dust your fingers with flour.",

Add butter, cream, orange juice, salt, cinnamon, remaining 1/2 teaspoon orange zest, pepper, and cayenne and process until completely smooth, 30 to 60 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed.\n\nTransfer potato puree to 2-quart soufflé dish and sprinkle evenly with reserved sugar-zest mixture. Broil sweet potatoes until topping is lightly browned and bubbling, 2 to 4 minutes. Serve.\n\n**TO MAKE AHEAD:** Processed potatoes can be refrigerated without topping for up to 2 days. To serve, cover dish with aluminum foil and bake on middle rack of 400-degree oven until hot throughout, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove foil, add brown sugar topping, and broil as directed in step 4.",

Remove from the heat and stir in the soy sauce. If necessary, add some water, a little at a time, until the salsa is the consistency of runny ketchup. Cool, taste and season with salt—it may not need any, depending on the saltiness of your soy sauce but keep in mind that Salsa Negra should be seasoned highly, both to preserve it for longer storage and to make it useful as a seasoning.  Transfer the salsa to a pint-size jar and store, covered, in the refrigerator, where it will last for a month or two.",

Cover and cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting heat as necessary to maintain vigorous simmer, until pork is tender and fork inserted into meat meets little resistance, about 1 hour.\n\nOff heat, use slotted spoon to transfer pork to bowl. Pour liquid into fat separator and let settle for 5 minutes; discard solids. Return defatted liquid to pot and cook over medium heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Stir in pork, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve. (Braised pork belly can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. To reheat, cook over low heat in covered Dutch oven until warmed through.)\n\nFOR THE SEASONED DAIKON: Toss daikon, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. (Daikon can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)\n\nFOR THE HOISIN-SOY SAUCE: Combine hoisin and soy sauces in small bowl.\n\nFOR THE BAO: Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, sugar, yeast, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add milk and shortening and continue to mix until no dry flour remains and dough has formed ball around hook, about 2 minutes longer. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and pulls away from sides of bowl, 5 minutes.\n\nTransfer dough to counter and knead briefly to form smooth ball. Grease medium bowl with ¼ teaspoon oil. Place dough in bowl and roll in oil to coat. Arrange dough in bowl seam side down and cover. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\n\nWhile dough rises, cut sixteen 4-inch squares of parchment paper. Divide squares evenly between 2 rimmed baking sheets (8 squares per sheet). Place remaining 2 tablespoons oil in small bowl.\n\nTransfer dough to counter. Press dough gently but firmly to expel all air. Knead briefly to form smooth ball. Using bench scraper or chef's knife, cut dough in half. Return half of dough to bowl and cover.\n\nRoll remaining dough into 8-inch log. Cut log into 8 equal portions (about 1⅓ ounces each) and cover. Using your fingertips, pat 1 portion to ¼-inch-thick disk (keep remaining portions covered). Fold edges toward center and pinch to form ball. Turn ball pinched side down and round to form smooth sphere. Cover and repeat with remaining 7 portions.\n\nRoll 1 dough ball into 6-inch oval. Transfer to small cutting board or plate and brush lightly with oil. Lightly brush chopstick with oil and lay it horizontally across center of oval. Fold oval in half over chopstick to form bun. Using chopstick, lift dough (it should drape evenly over both sides) and transfer to parchment square. Gently pull out chopstick, leaving bun folded. Repeat with remaining dough balls. Cover buns and let rise until slightly puffy, about 30 minutes. Repeat steps 11 and 12 with remaining dough, placing buns on second prepared sheet.\n\nMeanwhile, bring 4 cups water to boil in 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch skillet. Arrange first batch of buns, on parchment squares, in two 10-inch bamboo steamer baskets (4 buns per basket). Stack baskets and cover. Reduce heat to maintain simmer and set steamer in wok. Steam buns for 10 minutes (do not uncover, as buns might collapse; small wisps of steam should escape from beneath lid during cooking). Off heat, remove steamer from wok and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer buns, still on parchment, to wire rack. Steam remaining buns.\n\nTo serve, place slice of pork inside bun. Garnish with seasoned daikon; hoisin-soy sauce; cilantro; scallions; peanuts; and Thai chiles, if using. Serve immediately.\n\nSTORAGE AND REHEATING: Bao can be kept covered at room temperature for up to 3 hours or refrigerated for up to 3 days. To serve, resteam (on parchment squares) for 2 to 3 minutes. Alternatively, bao can be frozen for up to 1 month. Arrange cooled bao (on parchment squares) in zipper-lock bag. To serve, steam from frozen (on parchment squares) until warmed through, 7 to 8 minutes.",

    "directions": "For the first 5 minutes of cooking, the cauliflower steams in its own released moisture, so it is important not to lift the lid from the skillet during this time.\n\n1. Trim outer leaves of cauliflower and cut stem flush with bottom of head. Turn head so stem is facing down and cut head into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Cut around core to remove florets; discard core. Cut large florets into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer florets to bowl, including any small pieces that may have been created during trimming, and set aside.\n\n2. Heat cumin seeds and coriander seeds in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to spice grinder or mortar and pestle and coarsely grind. Wipe out skillet.\n\n3. Combine 2 tablespoons oil and cauliflower florets in now-empty skillet and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Cover skillet and cook over medium-high heat until florets start to brown and edges just start to become translucent (do not lift lid), about 5 minutes.\n\n4. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring every 2 minutes, until florets turn golden brown in many spots, about 12 minutes.\n\n5. Push cauliflower to edges of skillet. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil, paprika, cayenne, cumin-coriander mixture, and lime zest to center and cook, stirring with rubber spatula, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir spice mixture into cauliflower and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower is tender but still firm, about 3 minutes longer.\n\n6. Remove skillet from heat and stir in mint. Transfer cauliflower to serving platter and sprinkle with pistachios. Serve, passing lime wedges separately.",

    "ingredients": "1 whole chicken small, (about 3 lbs), trimmed of excess fat, giblets removed and discarded, chicken rinsed and patted dry\nTable salt and ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil plus 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil\n3 cloves garlic, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)\n1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves\n⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes\n2 tablespoons lemon juice from 1 lemon, plus 1 lemon cut into wedges\n1 ½ pounds Red Bliss potatoes (small), scrubbed, dried, and cut into 3/4 inch pieces\n1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves",
    "directions": "TECHNIQUE: BUTTERFLYING A CHICKEN With the breast side down and the tail of the chicken facing you, use poultry shears to cut along the length of one side of the backbone. With breast side still down, turn the neck end to face you, cut along the other side of the backbone and remove it. Turn the chicken breast-side up. Open the chicken on the work surface. Use the palm of your hand to flatten the chicken, then pound it with the flat side of a mallet to a fairly even thickness. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nAdjust an oven rack to the lowest position and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a heavy-bottomed 12-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to smoke. Swirl the skillet to coat evenly with oil. Place the chicken, skin-side down, in the hot pan and reduce the heat to medium. Place the weight (see the note above) on the chicken and cook, checking every 5 minutes or so, until evenly browned, about 25 minutes. (After 20 minutes, the chicken should be fairly crisp and golden; if not, turn the heat up to medium-high and continue to cook until well browned.)\n\nMeanwhile, mix the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, 1½ teaspoons of the thyme, the pepper flakes, lemon juice, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl and set aside.\n\nUsing tongs, carefully transfer the chicken, skin-side up, to a clean plate. Pour off any accumulated fat in the pan and add the potatoes, sprinkling them with ¼ teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper, and the remaining 1½ teaspoons thyme. Place the chicken, skin-side up, on the potatoes and brush the skin with the reserved thyme-lemon juice mixture.\n\nTransfer the pan to the oven and roast until the thickest part of the breast registers 160 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nReturn the skillet with the potatoes to the oven and roast until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to a large bowl, leaving the fat behind. Toss the potatoes with the parsley. Cut the chicken into pieces. Serve the chicken and potatoes immediately with the lemon wedges.\n\nLike this recipe? Share it, or leave a comment below.",

    "description": null,
    "notes": "It pays to use a high-quality ricotta rather than a watery supermarket brand. Look for fresh, creamy (not curdy) ricotta at an Italian grocer, gourmet market, or specialty cheese shop. This dish calls for a lot of black pepper, but the heat works well with the mild, creamy cheese. You can use penne in place of the shells.",

    "directions": "Combine stock, tomato paste, anchovies, gelatin, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender and blend on high speed until homogenous. Set aside.\n\nAdjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season beef all over with salt and pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet or large plate and set aside.\n\nAdd mushrooms to Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until liquid is released and mushrooms begin to brown, about 6 minutes, lowering heat as necessary to prevent scorching. Add diced carrots and pearl onions and cook, stirring, until well-browned on all sides. Season to taste with salt and pepper, transfer to a bowl, and set aside.\n\nAdd halved yellow onion to Dutch oven, cut-side-down. Add whole carrots, celery stalks, and garlic. Cook, turning carrots, celery, and garlic occasionally until all the vegetables are well-browned, about 4 minutes.\n\nAdd wine or sherry, scrape up browned bits with a wooden spoon, and cook until reduced by 3/4, about 3 minutes. Add broth mixture and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat.\n\nCut seared steaks into 1 1/2- to 2-inch chunks and transfer to a large bowl. Toss with flour. Add beef and any juices accumulated in the tray or plate to the Dutch oven along with bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Stir to combine and return to a simmer over medium heat. Transfer to oven, cover **with lid partially open**, and cook until beef is starting to become tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Liquid should hold a slow, steady simmer the entire time. Adjust oven temperature if necessary during cooking. 180 to 190°F is the ideal range\n\nRemove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard carrot, celery, thyme, bay leaves, onion, and garlic. Add potatoes and reserved sautéed mushrooms, pearl onions, and carrots to stew, return to oven, and continue to cook, partially covered, until beef, potatoes, and carrots are tender and broth has thickened, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n\nRemove stew from oven. If necessary, place over a burner and simmer for up to 15 minutes to reduce to desired consistency. Stir in peas. Season to taste with salt and pepper if necessary. Serve immediately, or refrigerate overnight or for up to 5 days and reheat to serve.",

    "directions": "Puree all marinade ingredients in blender until smooth, scraping down blender jar as needed.\n\nPlace steak on rimmed baking sheet or in large baking dish. Using dinner fork, prick steak about 20 times on each side. Rub both sides of steak evenly with salt and then with paste. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.\n\nUsing large chimney starter, ignite about 6 quarts (1 large chimney, or 2 1/2 pounds) charcoal briquettes and burn until covered with thin coating of light gray ash, about 20 minutes. Empty coals into grill; build two-level fire by arranging coals to cover one half of grill. Position grill grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate for 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush. Grill is ready when coals are hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above grate for just 2 seconds).\n\nUsing paper towels, wipe paste off steak; season both sides with pepper. Grill steak directly over coals until well browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Using tongs, flip steak; grill until second side is well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using paring knife, make small cut into thickest part of meat; if meat is slightly less done than desired, transfer steak to cutting board (meat will continue to cook as it rests). If steak is significantly underdone, position so that thinner side is over cool side of grill and thicker side is over hot side; continue to cook until thickest part is slightly less done than desired, then transfer steak to cutting board.\n\nLoosely tent steak with foil; let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Using sharp chef's knife or carving knife, slice steak about 1/4 inch thick against grain and on bias. Serve immediately.",

    "description": "Mushroom duxelles (pronounced duck-SELL) is an intensely flavored combination of finely chopped mushrooms, shallots, and fresh herbs such as thyme or parsley that are slowly cooked to a paste-like consistency. French in origin and named after the marquis d'Uxelles, this mushroom condiment is traditionally used in the preparation of beef Wellington, but it can also be used to flavor soups and sauces as well as to fill omelets and ravioli. It also happens to make for a delectable spread on crostini or toast points. Other creative uses include adding it as a flavor booster for mashed potatoes or mushroom-centric pasta dishes. \n\n The key ingredients in duxelles are mushrooms, butter, salt, and pepper. Any type of mushroom or a combination can be used, including cremini, morel, shiitake, porcini, and white button mushrooms, and ingredient variations can include shallots and/or garlic and chopped fresh parsley.\n\nAn important step in making duxelles is to remove as much moisture as possible from the mushrooms, both before cooking and during the process. They need to be cooked long enough so the mushrooms release their moisture and then cook completely until the liquid evaporates. This will prevent any unnecessary sogginess, which is essential to a crisp pastry for beef Wellington. ",

    "ingredients": "Vegetable oil for grill rack\n4 tablespoons Olive Oil\n9 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 3 tablespoons)\n1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary\nKosher Salt\n2 pounds Red Bliss potatoes (about 18), scrubbed, halved, and skewered according to illustration below (see note above)\nGround Black Pepper\nLarge disposable aluminum baking pan (13 by 9-inch)\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives",
    "directions": "This recipe allows you to grill an entree while the hot coals burn down in step 1. Once that item is done, start grilling the potatoes. This recipe works best with small potatoes that are about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. If using medium potatoes, 2 to 3 inches in diameter, cut potatoes into quarters. If potatoes are larger than 3 inches in diameter, cut each potato into eighths. Since potatoes are cooked in microwave, use wooden skewers.\n\n1. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal (6 quarts, or about 100 briquettes) and allow to burn until coals are fully ignited and covered with thin layer of ash, about 20 minutes. Empty coals into grill; build two-level fire by arranging two-thirds of coals over half of grill and arranging remaining coals in single layer over other half. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush. Remove lid and let coals burn until fire on hotter part of grill is medium (you can hold your hand 5 inches above grate for 5 to 6 seconds), about 10 minutes. Dip wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe cooking grate.\n\n2. Meanwhile, heat olive oil, garlic, rosemary, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in small skillet over medium heat until sizzling, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until garlic is light blond, about 3 minutes. Pour mixture through fine-mesh strainer into small bowl; press on solids. Measure 1 tablespoon solids and 1 tablespoon oil into large bowl and set aside. Discard remaining solids but reserve remaining oil.\n\n3. Place skewered potatoes in single layer on large microwave-safe plate and poke each potato several times with skewer. Brush with 1 tablespoon strained oil and season liberally with salt. Microwave on high power until potatoes offer slight resistance when pierced with tip of paring knife, about 8 minutes, turning them halfway through cooking time. Transfer potatoes to baking sheet coated with 1 tablespoon strained oil. Brush with remaining tablespoon strained oil; season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n4. Place potatoes on hotter side of grill. Cook, turning once, until grill marks appear, about 4 minutes. Move potatoes to cooler side of grill; cover with disposable pan and continue to cook until paring knife slips in and out of potatoes easily, 5 to 8 minutes longer. Remove potatoes from skewers and transfer to bowl with reserved garlic/oil mixture; add chives and toss until thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.\n\nTECHNIQUE\n\nSkewering Potatoes For the Grill\n\nPlace potato half cut-side down on work surface and pierce through center with skewer. Repeat, holding already-skewered potatoes for better leverage.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nFor potent garlic flavor in our grilled potato recipe, without bitterness or charring, we needed to introduce the potatoes to the garlic-oil mixture not once but three times.

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nFor a vegetarian bean chili recipe that was rich and highly flavorful, with a nice, sharp heat as well as some gentle sweetness, we narrowed down a list of eight initial contenders to three beans with an earthy flavor and firm texture—red kidney, pinto, and black. To season our vegetarian bean chili recipe we decided to add a sweet red pepper to our base of onions and garlic. Chili powder, along with whole cumin seeds and a little cayenne, provided the depth and heat we sought. For the liquid, we decided to stick with water and the customary tomatoes.",

Using 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil, cook the remaining tofu in the same way and transfer to the plate.\n\n03 In the same skillet, combine the remaining 1 teaspoon oil, the garlic, chili and scallion whites; cook over medium, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant and lightly browned, about 1 minute. Stir in the scallion greens, then return the tofu to the skillet and gently toss to combine. Transfer to a platter, scraping the bits from the pan onto the tofu.",
    "description": "Instead of deep-frying, a common cooking technique to make Chinese salt and pepper tofu, we coat the pieces of tofu with seasoned cornstarch, then pan-fry them in batches to brown and crisp the exteriors. In the empty skillet, a punchy mix of garlic, fresh chili and scallions is quickly cooked, and the tofu is tossed back in. The finished dish is sauceless but incredibly flavorful from the savory bits that cling to the tofu’s crisped surfaces.",

    "name": "These Crispy Smashed Potatoes Are a Hot Mess—and That's the Point",
    "ingredients": "For the Potatoes:\n2 pounds (900 g) small yellow or gold potatoes (see notes)\nKosher salt\n3 or 4 sprigs fresh thyme\nExtra-virgin olive oil, for pan-frying\nFor the Tonnato Sauce:\n1 large egg\n1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice (from 2 whole lemons), divided\n2 anchovy fillets (about 1/4 ounce; 7 g)\n1 teaspoon (5 ml) Dijon mustard\n1 teaspoon (5 g) drained capers\n1/2 cup (120 ml) vegetable oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml) extra-virgin olive oil\n4 ounces (113 g) oil-packed tuna, drained\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\nFor the Parsley Sauce:\n1 ounce (30 g) flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems\n1/2 cup (120 ml) extra-virgin olive oil\nKosher salt\nFor Serving:\n1/4 cup pitted olives, such as Taggiasca or Gaeta (see notes)\nAbout 2 tablespoons drained and minced Quick-Pickled Red Onion\nAbout 2 tablespoons chopped Calabrian chiles in oil or other jarred chiles in oil (see notes)",
    "directions": "For the Potatoes: In a large pot, cover potatoes with cold water, season heavily with salt, and add thyme. Bring to a boil over high heat , then reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cook until potatoes are completely tender, about 10 minutes after a boil is achieved (poke a potato with a sharp knife or cake tester to test for doneness). Drain in a colander set in the sink and let rest for 10 minutes to dry and cool slightly.\n\nWorking with one potato at a time, place potato on cutting board and smash firmly with the bottom of a heavy skillet to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Transfer to a large plate or tray as you work.\n\nIn a large nonstick or cast iron skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add as many potatoes as will fit in a single layer. Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until bottom side is deep golden brown, about 6 minutes. Carefully flip with a thin metal spatula and cook until second side is golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and allow to drain.\n\nContinue cooking potatoes in batches, adding more oil as necessary, until all potatoes are cooked. Potatoes can then be left aside until ready to serve.\n\nWhile the potatoes are boiling, make the Tonnato Sauce: Place egg, 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice, anchovies, mustard, and capers in a blender or food processor and, with the processor or blender running, slowly drizzle in vegetable oil followed by the olive oil until oil is fully emulsified and a mayonnaise has formed.\n\nTurn off processor or blender and scrape down sides of cup using a rubber spatula, then add tuna and remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice. Process or blend just until tuna is thoroughly incorporated into a smooth sauce, 15 to 30 seconds. Avoid over-blending, as this can cause the sauce to become grainy. Transfer tonnato sauce to a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Rinse out processor or blender jar.\n\nFor the Parsley Sauce: In the rinsed processor or blender, combine parsley with oil and blend until a fairly smooth sauce forms. Season with salt.\n\nTo Serve: On a large platter, spread a generous layer of tonnato sauce all over. Arrange potatoes on top (if they've cooled and you want to serve them warm, you can reheat them in a 400°F oven for about 6 minutes). Spoon some generous spoonfuls of parsley sauce on top along with a scattering of the olives, minced pickled onions, and chiles in oil. Serve. (Note, you will have leftovers of the sauces.)\n\nThe potatoes can be boiled and then cooled and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance. Once smashed and pan-fried, they can be held for a couple hours before reheating in a hot oven and serving.\n\nThe tonnato sauce and parsley oil can be refrigerated in airtight containers for up to 3 days.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Any small, creamy potato can work here, including Yukon Golds, yellow potatoes, red potatoes, and more.\n\nFeel free to substitute any chile-oil-type product or oily chile paste in place of the Calabrian chiles called for here; this recipe is flexible and can handle many substitutions.\n\nYou will have extra of the sauces. Save them for whatever you want—spoon them onto other vegetable dishes, roast chicken, fish, pork, or other meats, use them in sandwiches and salads, and more.",

    "ingredients": "4 ½ teaspoons salt\n1 tablespoon sugar\n12 ounces shell-on jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled, deveined, and tails removed, shells reserved\n4 ½ teaspoons Extra-virgin Olive Oil\n½ cup dry white wine\n2 sprigs fresh thyme\n4 ½ teaspoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving\n½ teaspoon cornstarch\n4 garlic cloves, sliced thin\n¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes\n⅛ teaspoon Pepper\n2 tablespoons Unsalted Butter, cut into ½-inch pieces\n1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh parsley",
    "directions": "Extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound) can be substituted for jumbo shrimp. If you use them, reduce the cooking time in step 3 by 1 to 2 minutes. We prefer untreated shrimp, but if your shrimp are treated with sodium or preservatives like sodium tripolyphosphate, skip the brining in step 1 and add 1/8 teaspoon of salt to the sauce in step 4. Serve with crusty bread.\n\n1. Dissolve salt and sugar in 2 cups cold water in container. Submerge shrimp in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Remove shrimp from brine and pat dry with paper towels.\n\n2. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in 10-inch skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp shells and cook, stirring frequently, until they begin to turn spotty brown and skillet starts to brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and carefully add wine and thyme sprigs. When bubbling subsides, return skillet to medium heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Strain mixture through colander set over large bowl. Discard shells and reserve liquid (you should have about 1/3 cup). Wipe out skillet with paper towels.\n\n3. Combine lemon juice and cornstarch in small bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil, garlic, pepper flakes, and pepper in now-empty skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is fragrant and just beginning to brown at edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Add reserved wine mixture, increase heat to high, and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium, add shrimp, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are just opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, and using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to bowl.\n\n4. Return skillet to medium heat, add lemon juice–cornstarch mixture and cook until slightly thickened, 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and parsley until combined. Return shrimp and any accumulated juices to skillet and toss to combine. Serve, passing lemon wedges separately.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nOur shrimp scampi recipe uses a few test kitchen tricks to ensure flavorful and well-cooked shrimp along with a cohesive, garlicky wine-and-butter sauce. First, we brine the shrimp in salt and sugar to season them throughout and keep them moist and juicy. Then we poach them in wine rather than sauté them, so they cook evenly and gently. To get good seafood flavor into the sauce, we make a stock from the shrimp shells. And for potent garlic flavor, we use a generous amount of sliced garlic—too much minced garlic made the sauce grainy. Finally, to keep the sauce silky and emulsified, we added a teaspoon of cornstarch. Emulsifying with cornstarch means that we can use a little less butter, so the sauce isn’t overly rich.",

Heat 1 teaspoon oil in skillet and repeat with remaining beef. Rinse skillet and dry with paper towels.\n\nAdd remaining tablespoon oil to now-empty skillet and heat until just smoking. Add mushrooms and cook until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add green beans and cook, stirring frequently, until spotty brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add water and cover pan; continue to cook until green beans are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Uncover skillet and push vegetables to sides to clear center; add garlic-ginger mixture to clearing and cook, mashing with spatula, until fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds. Combine garlic-ginger mixture with vegetables. Return beef and any juices to skillet, add scallions, and stir to combine. Whisk sauce to recombine, then add to skillet; cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 30 seconds. Serve.",

    "name": "Pasta Alla Zozzona (Rigatoni with Sausage, Guanciale, and Egg Yolks)",
    "ingredients": "3 large egg yolks (45g)\n2 ounces (60g) finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus more for serving\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n4 ounces (115g) guanciale (cured pork jowl) or pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch-thick batons (see note)\n6 ounces (170g) sweet or hot Italian sausage (2 links), removed from casing\n1 small onion (about 4 ounces; 115g), finely chopped\nPinch red pepper flakes (optional)\n2 cups (500g) tomato passata (see note)\n12 ounces (340g) rigatoni",
    "directions": "1. In a small bowl, beat egg yolks and Pecorino Romano together with a fork until they form a homogeneous thick paste, about 1 minute. Season with a few grindings of black pepper. Set aside. \n[photo:1]\n\n2. In a large skillet, cook guanciale over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and guanciale is golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Using slotted spoon, transfer guanciale to a plate. Set aside.\n[photo:2]\n\n3. Using clean hands, add sausage to skillet by pinching off 3/4- to 1-inch pieces and arranging in a single layer in the pan. Alternatively, add sausage to skillet all at once, then break up into pieces with a wooden spoon, spreading them out evenly in the pan. Cook over medium heat, undisturbed, until bottom side is light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add onion, season lightly with salt, and, using a thin metal spatula, turn sausage pieces onto uncooked side. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until sausage is cooked through, onion is softened, and fat in the pan is clear and no longer cloudy, 5 to 7 minutes; lower heat at any point if sausage or onion threaten to scorch.\n[photo:3]\n\n4. Add pepper flakes (if using) and bloom in rendered fat until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add tomato passata, season lightly with salt, and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened slightly and fat has emulsified into sauce, about 10 minutes.\n[photo:4]\n\n5. Meanwhile, in a pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook pasta until softened on the exterior, but well shy of al dente, and still uncooked in the center (about 3 minutes less than the package directs). Using a spider skimmer, transfer pasta to sauce, along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta cooking water. Transfer an additional 1/4 cup (60ml) pasta cooking water to bowl with reserved egg yolk-Pecorino Romano paste, and stir with a rubber spatula until smooth and well-combined; set aside. Alternatively, if you don't have a spider skimmer, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 1 1/2 cups (355ml) pasta cooking water, before proceeding with above instructions.\n[photo:5]\n\n6. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and coats noodles, about 2 minutes, adding more pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed.\n[photo:6]\n\nRemove skillet from heat, add cooked guanciale and egg yolk mixture, and stir and toss rapidly until fully incorporated and pasta is glossy, 15 to 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, passing more grated cheese at the table.",
    "description": "WHY IT WORKS\n- Slowly cooking guanciale and sausage in stages yields crisp morsels of pork and plenty of flavorful fat to build an emulsified sauce.\n- Finishing cooking the pasta in the sauce ensures that the noodles are well-coated and al dente.\n- Stirring starchy pasta water into a mixture of egg yolks and Pecorino Romano tempers the eggs, keeping them creamy and smooth when they are folded into the pasta off-heat.\n",

    "directions": "Bring 2 cups Marsala, gelatin, and porcini mushrooms to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and vigorously simmer until reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, cut each chicken breast in half crosswise, then cut thick half in half again horizontally, creating 3 cutlets of about same thickness. Place cutlets between sheets of plastic wrap and pound gently to even 1/2-inch thickness. Place cutlets in bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes.\n\nStrain Marsala reduction through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids.

    "directions": "1 .Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\n \n2. Remove and discard the chicken giblets. Pat the outside dry. Liberally salt and pepper the inside of the chicken. Cut the lemons in quarters, place 2 quarters in the chicken along with the garlic and reserve the rest of the lemons. Brush the outside of the chicken with olive oil and sprinkle the chicken liberally with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the chicken. Place the chicken in a small (11 by 14-inch) roasting pan. (If the pan is too large, the onions will burn.) Place the reserved lemons and the sliced onions in a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Pour the mixture around the chicken in the pan.\n \n3. Roast the chicken for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and a thigh. Remove the chicken to a platter, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes while you prepare the sauce, leaving the lemons and onions in the pan.\n \n4. Place the pan on top of the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the wine and stir with a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits. Add the stock and sprinkle on the flour, stirring constantly for a minute, until the sauce thickens. Add any juices that collect under the chicken. Carve the chicken onto a platter and serve with the lemons, onions, and warm sauce.\n\n",

Transfer olive mixture to bowl with onion mixture. Add ¼ cup oil, mustard, and pepper and toss to combine.\n\nBrush inside of each baguette half with 1 tablespoon oil. Place two-thirds of olive mixture in hollow of baguette bottom and spread evenly. Distribute tuna evenly over olive mixture and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Shingle tomato slices over tuna. Shingle egg slices over tomato. Top eggs with remaining olive mixture and cap with baguette top (sandwich will be very full).\n\nPress gently on sandwich and slice in half crosswise on bias. Wrap each half tightly in plastic wrap. Place rimmed baking sheet on top of sandwiches and weight with heavy Dutch oven or two 5-pound bags of flour or sugar for 1 hour, flipping sandwiches halfway through weighting. (Wrapped sandwiches can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let come to room temperature before serving.)\n\nUnwrap sandwiches, slice each sandwich in half (or in thirds to serve 6) on bias, and serve.",

    "directions": "Heat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. In a large (at least 7-quart) Dutch oven, stir together the pork, onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, oregano, thyme, pepper flakes and 2 teaspoons salt. Stir in the oil and 1 cup water. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook for 3 hours.\n\nRemove the pot from the oven. Stir the pork and return the pot, uncovered, to the oven. Cook until a skewer inserted into the meat meets no resistance, another 30 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a rimmed baking sheet in an even layer to cool. Tilt the pot to pool the cooking liquid to one side, then use a wide spoon to skim off as much fat as possible; reserve the fat. Bring the defatted cooking liquid to a simmer over medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about ⅓ cup, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\n\nWhen the meat is cool enough to handle, break the chunks into ¾- to 1-inch pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat. Add the pork back to the pot and stir until evenly moistened with the reduced cooking liquid.\n\nIn a nonstick 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 teaspoon of the reserved fat until barely smoking. Add the pork in an even layer and cook without stirring, pressing the meat against the skillet with a spatula, until the bottom begins to brown and the pork is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Tip: Don't trim the fat from the pork shoulder. The pork should render its fat in the oven and so the meat cooks slowly in it and the juices. And after cooking, don't discard the fat you skim off the cooking liquid—you'll need some of it to crisp the shredded pork in a hot skillet.",

    "ingredients": "1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n1-1/2 tsp. coarse salt\n1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper\n1 lb. ground beef, medium lean (80 or 85%)\n2 Tbs. vegetable oil; more if necessary\n4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped\n1 Tbs. red curry paste (I like Krung Gaeng Ped brand); more to taste\n1 cup canned coconut milk (refrigerate the can, don’t shake it, and use the thick cream at the top)\n2 Tbs. chunky peanut butter\n2 tsp. fish sauce (nam pla) or to taste\n1-1/2 Tbs. sugar or to taste\n1 tsp. chopped fresh mint or basil leaves for garnish",
    "directions": "Put the flour on a plate. Put the beef in a bowl, sprinkle with the salt and pepper, and mix well. Shape the beef into small, firm balls about 1 inch in diameter; you’ll get 32 to 40. Roll the meatballs in the flour, dusting off the excess.\n\nLine a plate with paper towels. In a wok or frying pan, heat the oil on high until it’s hot. Fry the garlic until browned, about 1 minute; remove and set aside. Add the meatballs and sear them on high heat, stirring and tilting the pan, until they’re browned evenly and cooked through, about 5 minutes; do this in batches, if necessary. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meatballs to the paper towel-lined plate to drain.\n\nIf no oil remains in the pan, add 2 tsp. and fry the red curry paste so it releases its aromas, about 2 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking. Add the reserved garlic and the solidified coconut milk and then stir in the peanut butter. Cook and stir to get a smooth, uniform consistency, about 1 minute. Taste and add fish sauce, sugar, or more curry paste to taste; the sauce shouldn’t be too sweet.\n\nReturn the meatballs to the pan with the sauce and simmer over low heat until they’re hot, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the mint or basil sprinkled on top.",

    "directions": "1. Heat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. Place a V-rack inside a large roasting pan. In a small bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons of coriander, 1 tablespoon of cumin, the paprika, garam masala, cayenne and 2 teaspoons salt. Working over a large plate, rub all of the spice mixture evenly over the chicken, using all of the rub and any that has fallen onto the plate, then tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Transfer the chicken breast side up to the rack in the roasting pan. Roast until well browned, the thickest part of the breast reaches 160°F and the thickest part of the thigh reaches 175°F, 70 to 80 minutes.\n\n3. While the chicken cooks, in a food processor, combine the arugula, cilantro, garlic, serranos, the remaining 1 tablespoon coriander, the remaining 1 tablespoon cumin and 1 teaspoon salt. Process until coarsely chopped, about 30 seconds. With the machine running, pour the oil through the feed tube, then process until finely chopped, another 30 seconds. Transfer to a small bowl, then stir in the lime juice. Cover and refrigerate.\n\n3. When the chicken is done, transfer it to a cutting board and let rest for 30 minutes. Remove the rack from the roasting pan. While the chicken rests, add ½ cup water to the roasting pan and stir, scraping up any browned bits. Pour the liquid into a medium bowl, then let settle for 5 minutes. Skim off and discard any fat from the surface. Stir 3 tablespoons of the defatted liquid into the arugula-cilantro mixture, then taste and season with salt and pepper; discard the remaining liquid.\n\n4. Carve the chicken and arrange on a platter. Drizzle with about 3 tablespoons of the chutney, then serve with lime wedges and the remaining chutney on the side.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Don't tent the chicken with foil as it rests or the trapped steam will cause the skin to turn soggy. Also, make sure to allow the chicken to rest for about 30 minutes before carving. If cut too soon, the juices will flow out rather than remain in the meat and keep it moist.",

    "name": "Stuffed Chicken Breasts",
    "ingredients": "4 chicken breasts large, boneless, skinless \n3 tablespoons vegetable oil \n10 ounces white button mushrooms trimmed, wiped clean, and sliced thin \n1 small leeks white part halved lengthwise, washed, and chopped (about 1 cup) \n2 medium garlic cloves minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons) \n1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme chopped \n1 tablespoons fresh lemon juice about 1 lemon \n1/2 cups dry white wine \n1 tablespoons fresh parsley chopped \n1 cups chicken broth * Swanson Organic low-sodium \n1 teaspoons Dijon mustard \n2 tablespoons unsalted butter \n",
    "directions": "FOR THE CHICKEN: Use tip of sharp chefs knife to cut each breast horizontally, starting at thinnest end and stopping knife tip 1/2 inch away from edge so that halves remain attached. Open up breasts to create 4 cutlets. Place 1 cutlet at a time in heavy-duty zipper-lock bag and pound to 1/4-inch thickness (cutlet should measure about 8 inches by 6 inches). Trim about 1/2 inch from long sides of cutlets (about 1 1/2 to 2 ounces of meat per cutlet, or a total of 1/2 cup from all 4 cutlets) to form rectangles that measure about 8 by 5 inches. Process all trimmings in food processor until smooth, about 20 seconds. Transfer puree to medium bowl and set aside. (Do not wash out food processor bowl.)\n\nFOR THE STUFFING: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until all moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are golden brown, 8 to 11 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil and leek; continue to cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 2 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and thyme, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice and cook until all moisture has evaporated, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to bowl of food processor. Return pan to heat; add wine and scrape pan bottom to loosen browned bits. Transfer wine to small bowl and set aside. Rinse and dry skillet.\n\nPulse mushroom mixture in food processor until roughly chopped, about five 1-second pulses. Transfer mushroom mixture to bowl with pureed chicken. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons parsley, 3/4 teaspoon table salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Using rubber spatula, fold together stuffing ingredients until well combined (you should have about 1 1/2 cups stuffing).\n\nTO ASSEMBLE AND COOK: With thinnest ends of cutlets pointing away from you, spread one-quarter of stuffing evenly over each cutlet with rubber spatula, leaving 3/4-inch border along short sides of cutlet and 1/4-inch border along long sides. Roll each breast up as tightly as possible without squeezing out filling and place seam-side down. Evenly space 3 pieces twine (each about 12 inches long) beneath each breast and tie, trimming any excess.\n\nSeason chicken with salt and pepper. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken bundles and brown on 4 sides, about 2 minutes per side. Add broth and reserved wine to pan and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pan, and cook until instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees when inserted into thickest part of chicken, 12 to 18 minutes. Transfer chicken to cutting board and tent loosely with foil.\n\nTO MAKE SAUCE AND SERVE: While chicken rests, whisk mustard into cooking liquid. Increase heat to high and simmer, scraping pan bottom to loosen browned bits, until dark brown and reduced to 1/2 cup, 7 to 10 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons parsley and 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Remove twine and cut each chicken bundle on bias into 6 medallions. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "If your chicken breasts come with the tenderloin attached, pull them off (see Removing Chicken Tenderloins below) \r\nand reserve them to make the puree in step 1. If necessary, trim these breasts to make uniform rectangles and to yield \r\n1 1/2 to 2 ounces total trimmings per breast. Because the stuffing contains raw chicken, it is important to check its \r\ntemperature in step 5.",

Whisk flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in medium bowl. In second medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk, sour cream, eggs, and melted butter. Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients; gently stir until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour). Do not overmix. Allow batter to sit 10 minutes before cooking.\n\nHeat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Using paper towels, carefully wipe out oil, leaving thin film of oil on bottom and sides of pan. Using ¼ cup measure, portion batter into pan in 4 places. Cook until edges are set, first side is golden brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes. Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Serve pancakes immediately, or transfer to wire rack in preheated oven. Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining oil as necessary.\n\nThe pancakes can be cooked on an electric griddle. Set the griddle temperature to 350 degrees and cook as directed. The test kitchen prefers a lower-protein all-purpose flour like Gold Medal or Pillsbury. If you use an all-purpose flour with a higher protein content, like King Arthur, you will need to add an extra tablespoon or two of buttermilk.\n\n",

Sprinkle barbecue rub all over armadillo eggs, then place eggs on cool side grill and cover, with top air vent positioned over cool side of grill.

    "directions": "Marinating the onion and cucumber in the vinaigrette tones down the onion's harshness and flavors the cucumber. For efficiency, prepare the other salad ingredients while the onion and cucumber marinate. Use a salad spinner to dry the lettuce thoroughly after washing; any water left clinging to the leaves will dilute the dressing.\n\n1. Whisk vinaigrette ingredients in large bowl until combined. Add onion and cucumber and toss; let stand to blend flavors, about 20 minutes.\n\n2. Add romaine, tomatoes, parsley, mint, and peppers to bowl with onions and cucumbers; toss to coat with dressing.\n\n3. Transfer salad to wide, shallow serving bowl or platter; sprinkle olives and feta over salad. Serve immediately.",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nMost versions of Greek salad consist of iceberg lettuce, chunks of green pepper, and a few pale wedges of tomato, sparsely dotted with cubes of feta and garnished with one forlorn olive of questionable heritage. For our Greek salad, we aimed a little higher: We wanted a salad with crisp ingredients and bold flavors, highlighted by briny olives and tangy feta, all blended together with a bright-tasting dressing infused with fresh herbs. For a dressing with balanced flavor, we used a combination of lemon juice and red wine vinegar and added fresh oregano, olive oil, and a small amount of garlic. We poured the dressing over fresh vegetables, including Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers, as well as other ingredients, including fresh mint and parsley, roasted peppers, and a generous sprinkling of feta cheese and olives.",

    "ingredients": "206 grams (1½ cups) bread flour, plus more for dusting\n35 grams (¼ cup) whole-wheat flour\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n3/4 cup plain whole-milk yogurt\n2 teaspoons honey\n3 tablespoons salted butter, melted, or flavored butter",
    "directions": "01 In a large bowl, stir together both flours, the salt and baking powder. Add the yogurt and honey and stir until a shaggy dough forms. Using your hands, knead in the bowl until the dough forms a cohesive ball, incorporating any dry bits; the dough will be slightly sticky.\n\n02 Turn the dough out onto a counter dusted with bread flour and continue kneading until the dough is tacky instead of sticky, about 1 minute. The finished dough may appear slightly lumpy; this is fine. Divide into 6 pieces and shape each into a ball. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high.\n\n03 On a lightly floured counter, roll each ball to an 8-inch circle. Place one dough round in the heated skillet and cook until the bottom is dark spotty brown, 1 to 1½ minutes. Using tongs, flip the round and cook the second side until dark spotty brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a wire rack, flipping so the first side to cook faces down, then brush with butter. Repeat with the remaining dough rounds. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "Made throughout the Middle East, non-yeasted flatbreads are the definition of quick bread, taking relatively little time to prepare. We added yogurt to a whole wheat- and honey-flavored dough for both its tangy bite and tenderizing qualities. Bread flour gives these flatbreads pleasant chew, but you can substitute an equal amount of all-purpose flour. If you do use all-purpose, you will likely have to add a couple extra tablespoons of flour during kneading because the dough will be slightly wetter. You'll need a 12-inch cast-iron skillet; a 10-inch cast-iron skillet will work, too, but there will be a little less room for maneuvering the rounds when flipping. We liked serving these with flavored butters—including garlic-herb, za'atar and harissa.\n\nDon't leave any floury bits in the bowl during mixing. All the flour must be incorporated so that the dough isn't too sticky to work with. Don't overflour the counter when rolling out the rounds; excess flour will scorch in the skillet.",

    "ingredients": "2 cups (500ml) homemade chicken stock or store-bought low-sodium broth\n4 packets unflavored powdered gelatin (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon; 30g)\n2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil, plus more as needed\n3 pounds (1.25kg) whole boneless beef chuck roast, cut crosswise into 3 steaks\n4 teaspoons (12g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, divided; for table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 1/4 pounds carrots (600g; about 3 large), 1/2 pound (250g) peeled and split lengthwise, 3/4 pound (350g) cut into large dice (about 1 1/2 cups)\n1 medium yellow onion (8 ounces; ; 227g), peeled and split in half through the root\n4 medium cloves garlic, lightly crushed\n1/4 cup (60ml) cognac or brandy (optional)\n3 cups (750ml) dry red wine\n1 tablespoon (15ml) fish sauce\n1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce\n1 bouquet garni (about 4 sprigs thyme, 3 sprigs parsley, and 1 bay leaf, tied together with kitchen twine)\n5 tablespoons all-purpose flour (1.4 ounces; 40g)\n1/4 pound (110g) slab bacon or salt pork, cut into 1-inch-long by 1/4-inch-thick sticks (about 1 cup)\n1 pound cremini mushrooms (450g), woody stems trimmed if necessary and caps quartered\n8 ounces white and/or red pearl onions (225g), peeled\nMinced flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems, for garnish",
    "directions": "Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Pour chicken stock into a medium bowl and sprinkle gelatin evenly all over surface, allowing each packet's worth of gelatin to soak up stock before sprinkling next one on. Set aside.\n\nIn a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season beef all over with 3 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet.\n\nLower heat to medium; add split carrots, halved onion, and garlic to Dutch oven and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes.\n\nAdd brandy, if using, and boil until alcohol has nearly cooked off, about 2 minutes. (If not using brandy, proceed with next step.)\n\nScrape chicken stock and gelatin mixture into Dutch oven. Add red wine, fish sauce, soy sauce, and bouquet garni and bring to a simmer over medium high, then lower heat to medium to maintain simmer. Meanwhile, cut beef into 2-inch chunks and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add flour and stir until beef is evenly coated in a floury paste. Add beef and any accumulated juices to Dutch oven. Bring back to a simmer then transfer to oven, partially cover with a lid, and cook until beef starts to become tender, about 2 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, cook bacon lardons over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and lardons are lightly browned and crisp, 4 to 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer lardons to a plate.\n\nAdd mushrooms to skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have released their liquid and browned, about 10 minutes; add oil as needed if pan becomes too dry. Add diced carrots and pearl onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\n\nRemove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard large pieces of carrot and onion. Discard bouquet garni. Using a ladle, skim off and discard accumulated fat on surface. Add reserved lardons and sautéed carrots, onions, and mushrooms to stew, return to oven, and continue to cook, uncovered, until beef is fork tender, pearl onions are soft but still hold their shape, and sauce is nappe, about 1 hour.\n\nRemove stew from oven. If serving right away, skim off any additional fat from surface. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow to cool slightly before serving, then serve topped with parsley. If making ahead, cool down stew, then chill in refrigerator; remove solid fat cap from surface once fully chilled. Reheat stew on the stovetop or in a low oven.\n\nThe stew can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.",

    "directions": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Using a sharp knife, cut all around the top of the bread loaf, and remove the top or \"lid\" of the bread. Set this \"lid\" aside, to eat or use in another recipe. Then, measuring in about 3/4 inch from the edge of the loaf, cut down into and all around the loaf, taking care not to penetrate the bottom, to create a neat edge from which to remove the interior crumb. Twist the soft insides to loosen them, then pull them out, so you have a large receptacle or shell. If the insides of the bread are very soft, cut them into pieces and dry them briefly in the hot oven. Then place about half of the insides into the bowl of a food processor, and process to make 2½ to 3 cups of crumbs. Set these aside, and keep the remainder of the bread insides for another use. \n\nFor the garlic-herb butter: Put the parsley, other herbs, and garlic in the food-processor bowl, and process until the mixture is chopped fine. Add the pecans, softened butter, salt, pepper, and white wine, and process until blended. Stir in the shallots. Using a large spatula, coat the inside of the hollow loaf with about a third of the garlic-herb butter. \n\nCut the shrimp, scallops, and salmon into 1-inch pieces, and slice the mushrooms. Sprinkle half the mushrooms and half the seafood into the bread receptacle, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Add a layer of the garlic-herb butter, then about half of the breadcrumbs, and the remainder of the seafood and mushrooms. Season lightly with salt and pepper. \n\nFinally, spread the remaining butter on top, cover with the remaining breadcrumbs, and moisten the breadcrumbs with the vermouth. Place the filled bread loaf on a cookie sheet, and bake for about 1 hour. Let the bread rest for 10 minutes after it comes out of the oven, then cut it into large chunks, and serve immediately.",

In large bowl, whisk together yogurt, oil, garlic, and ginger; set aside.\n\nFOR THE SAUCE: Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until light golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, chile, tomato paste, and garam masala; cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, sugar, and salt; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in cream and return to simmer. Remove pan from heat and cover to keep warm.\n\nWhile sauce simmers, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position (about 6 inches from heating element) and heat broiler. Using tongs, dip chicken into yogurt mixture (chicken should be coated with thick layer of yogurt) and arrange on wire rack set in foil-lined rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan. Discard excess yogurt mixture. Broil chicken until thickest parts register 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer and exterior is lightly charred in spots, 10 to 18 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking.\n\nLet chicken rest 5 minutes, then cut into 1-inch chunks and stir into warm sauce (do not simmer chicken in sauce). Stir in cilantro, adjust seasoning with salt, and serve.\n\n",

    "notes": "This dish is best when prepared with whole-milk yogurt, but low-fat yogurt can be substituted. For a spicier dish, do not remove the ribs and seeds from the chile. If you prefer, substitute 2 teaspoons ground coriander, 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper for the garam masala. The sauce can be made ahead, refrigerated for up to 4 days in an airtight container, and gently reheated before adding the hot chicken. Serve with basmati rice.",

    "directions": "FOR THE SAUCE: Whisk all ingredients together in bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.)\n\nFOR THE BEEF: Sprinkle beef with 4 teaspoons (16 grams) kosher salt. Arrange pieces side by side along natural seam, and then tie together at 1 inch intervals to create 1 evenly shaped roast. Wrap roast in plastic, transfer to large plate, and refrigerate at least 24 hours or up to 96 hours.\n\nUsing sous vide circulator, heat water to 133°F/56°C in 12-quart container.\n\nHeat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown roast on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Season roast with pepper and place into 2-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Gently lower bag into prepared water bath until roast is fully submerged, and then clip top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook for at least 18 hours or up to 24 hours.\n\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475°F/246°C. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and spray with vegetable spray. Transfer roast to prepared rack and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Pat roast dry with paper towels.\n\nWhisk egg white in bowl until frothy, about 30 seconds. Combine peppercorns and flake sea salt in shallow dish. Brush roast on all sides with egg white, then coat with peppercorn mixture, pressing to adhere. Return roast to prepared rack and roast until surface is evenly browned and fragrant, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through roasting.\n\nTransfer roast to carving board and slice into ½-inch-thick slices, removing pieces of twine as you slice, and serve.\n\nLike this recipe?

    "description": "True one-pan meals are hard to come by, but one that also cooks all the components at once—without adding ingredients in stages—is a unicorn. For a totally hands-off one-pan meal of meatloaf, roasted potatoes, and Brussels sprouts, we started by choosing straightforward meatloaf ingredients that didn’t require precooking (such as mushrooms or onions). A panade of crushed saltines and milk kept the ground beef moist in the oven. Soy sauce and grated Parmesan cheese added savory depth to the meatloaf while fresh thyme, granulated garlic, and red pepper flakes added pep. Two eggs held the meatloaf together, and a coating of ketchup turned into an intensely sweet and tangy glaze that nicely complemented the meat. Hearty small red potatoes and Brussels sprouts were the perfect vegetables to roast alongside the meatloaf; they only got better the longer they cooked in the 400-degree oven, turning creamy inside and deeply browned and crisp on the bottom. To brighten up the vegetables’ deep roasted flavor, we gave them a quick toss in a lemon-parsley oil just before serving",

    "directions": "FOR THE SAUCE: Heat oil, chili powder, peppercorns, and cinnamon in 14-inch wok or 12-inch nonstick skillet over low heat for 10 minutes. Using rubber spatula, transfer oil mixture to bowl (do not wash wok). Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, wheat paste, and sesame paste into oil mixture. Divide evenly among 4 shallow bowls.\n\nFOR THE NOODLES: Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. While water comes to boil, combine pork, Shaoxing wine, and soy sauce in medium bowl and toss with your hands until well combined. Set aside. Working with 1 head bok choy at a time, trim base (larger leaves will fall off) and halve lengthwise through core. Rinse well.\n\nHeat 2 teaspoons oil in now-empty wok over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add reserved pork mixture and use rubber spatula to smear into thin layer across surface of wok. Break up meat into ¼-inch chunks with edge of spatula and cook, stirring frequently, until pork is firm and well browned, about 5 minutes. Push pork mixture to far side of wok and add garlic, ginger, and remaining 1 teaspoon oil to cleared space. Cook, stirring constantly, until garlic mixture begins to brown, about 1 minute. Stir to combine pork mixture with garlic mixture. Remove wok from heat.\n\nAdd bok choy to boiling water and cook until leaves are vibrant green and stems are crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Using slotted spoon or spider skimmer, transfer boy choy to plate; set aside. Add noodles to boiling water and cook, stirring often, until almost tender (center should still be firm with slightly opaque dot). Drain noodles. Rinse under hot running water, tossing with tongs, for 1 minute. Drain well.\n\nDivide noodles evenly among prepared bowls. Return wok with pork to medium heat. Add ya cai and cook, stirring frequently, until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Spoon equal amounts of pork topping over noodles. Divide bok choy evenly among bowls, shaking to remove excess moisture as you portion. Top with scallions and serve, leaving each diner to stir components together before eating.",

    "notes": "\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nSichuan's most popular street food consists of chewy noodles bathed in a spicy, fragrant chili sauce and topped with crispy, deeply savory bits of pork and plump, juicy lengths of baby bok choy. Gently heating Sichuan chili powder, ground Sichuan peppercorns, and cinnamon in vegetable oil for just 10 minutes yielded a flavorful chili oil base for the sauce. Whisking in soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar, sweet wheat paste, and Chinese sesame paste added earthy, faintly sweet depth and appropriately thickened the mixture. We smeared the ground pork into a thin layer across the wok with a rubber spatula, jabbing at it with the tool's edge to break it up into bits, and seared it hard to produce crispy bits that clung to the noodles. Stirring in minced garlic and grated ginger, plus a big scoop of the Sichuan pickle called ya cai, added unique tang and complexity. Blanching baby bok choy brightened its color and freed water from its cell walls, giving the vegetable its juicy, palate-cleansing effect. We trimmed the base of each bulb and halved the bulbs lengthwise to create bite-size pieces that softened at the same rate. Saving the blanching water to boil the noodles was efficient, and thoroughly rinsing them after they were cooked washed away surface starch that would have caused them to stick together. ",

    "directions": "\t1. FOR THE PASTE: Mince garlic clove with salt to form smooth paste. Combine garlic paste with olive oil, lemon juice, and chopped fresh oregano leaves in a medium bowl. Set aside.\n\t2. FOR THE SHRIMP: Pour 2 quarts very cold water into large bowl. Add salt and sugar and stir until dissolved. Add shrimp and let stand in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Drain shrimp. Open shells with manicure scissors and devein if desired (see illustrations below). Toss shrimp and paste in medium bowl to coat.\n\t3. Meanwhile, light large chimney starter filled with hardwood charcoal (about 2 1/2 pounds) and allow to burn until charcoal is covered with layer of fine gray ash. Spread coals evenly over grill bottom for medium-hot fire. Set cooking rack in place, cover grill with lid, and let rack heat up, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, preheat gas grill with all burners set to high and lid down until grill is very hot, about 15 minutes. Scrape rack clean with wire brush.\n\t4. Thread shrimp on skewers as illustrated below. Grill shrimp, uncovered for charcoal or covered for gas, turning skewers once, until shells are barely charred and bright pink, 4 to 6 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature with lemon wedges.\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "We recommend that you brine the shrimp before grilling. This makes them especially plump and juicy. To keep the shrimp from dropping through the grill rack onto the hot coals, thread them onto skewers. The fresh oregano in this recipe can be replaced with other fresh herbs, including chives, tarragon, parsley, or basil.",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "**Prepare ahead**\n\nFor best results, prepare each piece individually. If you don't want to measure the dry ingredients every time you bake, feel free to prepare your own baking mix ahead. Take 10 tablespoons (150 ml) almond flour, 10 tablespoons (150 ml) coconut flour, 1 teaspoon salt and 2 1/2 tablespoons baking powder. Then you have the dry mix ready for 10 pieces. Use 2 generous tablespoons for each piece of bread.\n\n**Storing the bread**\n\nFeel free to make several pieces once you get cooking. You can keep the unbaked dough in the refrigerator for 2-3 days or you can even freeze the mixture. It will thaw in a few minutes at room temperature.\n\nFlavoring\n\nFor additional flavor, season the bread with onion or garlic powder, plus herbs or spices like ground fennel and cumin. It's also lovely with poppy, chia, hemp, or sesame seeds. Use about 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning for each piece.",

Cover bowl and refrigerate chicken for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.\n\nTightly thread chicken strips lengthwise onto skewers in S shape until no more than 1 inch of skewer is exposed on either end, 4 or 5 strips per skewer.\n\nFOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\nFOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high; cover; and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.\n\nClean and oil cooking grate. Place kebabs on grill (over coals, if using charcoal) and cook (covered, if using gas) until chicken is lightly charred and registers 160 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to serving platter and let rest while preparing tahini-butter sauce.\n\nFOR THE TAHINI-BUTTER SAUCE: Whisk tahini, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and oregano in bowl until combined. Slowly whisk in melted butter until emulsified.\n\nDrizzle tahini-butter sauce over chicken and serve.",
    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\n\nSouvlaki is a dish of marinated meat (or occasionally vegetables) threaded onto skewers or a spit (“souvla” means “spit” in Greek) and cooked over a fire. We had a version at Johnny's Restaurant in Homewood, Alabama, that we couldn't forget. Inspired by chef Timothy Hontzas's technique, we first marinated strips of boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a bold mixture of lemon zest, olive oil, oregano, thyme, and other seasonings. We then threaded the strips onto skewers in an S shape, which allowed the potent marinade to get stuck in the crannies of the folded chicken, providing concentrated pops of flavor. After getting some good char on the meat by grilling it over high heat, we drizzled it with a tahini-butter sauce (also inspired by the version at Johnny's Restaurant) to cloak the chicken with an extra layer of richness and allure.",
    "notes": "2025-04-20 - made with chicken breast. Very good, just use thermometer to not overcook \n2022-05-30 - Made at Dad and Moms using chicken thighs. Crowd pleaser.",

    "notes": "Take care to cut the potatoes into evenly sized wedges so that all of the pieces will cook at about the same rate. Although it isn’t required, a nonstick baking sheet works particularly well for this recipe. It not only keeps the fries from sticking to the pan but, because of its dark color, encourages deep and even browning. Whether you choose a nonstick baking sheet or a regular baking sheet, make sure that it is heavy duty. The intense heat of the oven may cause lighter pans to warp.",

    "name": "Chicken, Salsa Verde and Tortilla Casserole (Pastel Azteca)",
    "ingredients": "1 pound poblano chilies\n1½ pounds tomatillos, husked and halved\n3 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled\n2 tablespoons white vinegar\n1 cup lightly packed fresh cilantro, plus ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided\n3 teaspoons ground cumin, divided\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oil\n1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n1 large white onion, chopped\n1 cup corn kernels, defrosted if frozen\n8 6-inch corn tortillas\n12 ounces pepper Jack cheese, shredded (4 cups)\n1 cup Mexican crema or one 8-ounce container crème fraîche, room temperature\n4 ounces cotija cheese (see headnote), grated (1 cup)\n2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds, finely chopped (optional)\n",
    "directions": "01 Heat the broiler with a rack about 6 inches from the element. Place the poblanos on a rimmed baking sheet and broil until charred, about 10 minutes. Flip the chilies and broil until charred on the second sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, cover and let steam to loosen the skins while you make the puree and cook the chicken. Turn the oven to 375°F.\n\n02 In a blender, combine the tomatillos, garlic, vinegar, 1 cup of cilantro, 2 teaspoons of cumin and 1 teaspoons salt. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping the blender jar as needed; set the puree aside.\n\n03 In a large Dutch oven over medium-high, heat the oil until shimmering. Carefully add the puree (it may splatter) and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced and a spoon drawn through leaves a brief trail, about 6 minutes. Remove ½ cup of the sauce and set aside. To the remaining sauce in the pot, add the chicken, onion, the remaining 1 teaspoon cumin, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Bring to a simmer, then cover, reduce to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until a skewer inserted into the chicken meets no resistance, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n04 While the chicken cooks, peel the skins off the chilies and remove and discard the stems and seeds. Chop the chilies and set aside. When the chicken is done, remove the pot from the heat. Using 2 forks, shred the chicken; you should have about 3½ cups chicken in salsa verde. If you have more, return the pot to medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced. Stir in the corn, the ¼ cup of the chopped cilantro and the chopped chilies. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n05 Wrap the exterior of a 9-inch springform pan with a sheet of foil and set on a rimmed baking sheet. Add half of the reserved salsa to the pan and spread in an even layer. Line the bottom of the pan with 2⅔ tortillas, tearing them as needed to fit; it’s fine if the tortillas overlap slightly and if a few small spots are uncovered. Spoon in half of the chicken mixture and distribute in an even layer. Dollop with half of the crema, then spread evenly. Sprinkle with a third of the pepper Jack cheese. Repeat the layering using another 2⅔ tortillas, the remaining chicken mixture, the remaining crema and half of the remaining pepper Jack. Layer in the remaining tortillas, then spread evenly with the remaining reserved salsa. Sprinkle on the remaining pepper Jack followed by the cotija. Bake the pastel on the baking sheet until browned on top and bubbling at the edges, about 35 minutes.\n\n06 Set the baking sheet on a wire rack. Sprinkle the pastel with the remaining ¼ cup chopped cilantro and the pumpkin seeds (if using). Let rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.\n\n07 To serve, run a knife around the inside of the springform pan to loosen. Remove the foil, set the pan on a large, flat platter and remove the sides. Cut into wedges and serve.",
    "description": "Though pastel azteca translates from the Spanish as “Aztec cake,” the dish often is referred to in English as Mexican lasagna, enchilada casserole or tortilla pie—and understandably so. It is comprised of corn tortillas layered with sauce, meat, cheeses, crema (a cultured cream similar to crème fraîche) and vegetables; a stint in the oven brings together all the elements. Our recipe is an adaptation of the pastel azteca taught to us in Mexico City by chef Esmerelda Brinn Bolaños. We swapped chicken thighs for the dark-meat turkey that she used and found readily available substitutes for the locally made Mexican cheeses. We opted for pepper Jack cheese because of its melting qualities and mild spiciness; if you prefer, use regular Jack cheese or even mozzarella. To assemble and bake the casserole, we use a 9-inch springform pan for a presentation that reveals the impressive layers and allows for slicing into wedges for serving. ",
    "notes": "Don’t use sour cream in place of Mexican crema. Sour cream has a lower fat content and will curdle during baking. If crema is not available, crème fraîche is the next best option, but it’s much thicker than crema, so allow it to come to room temperature before use so it’s easier to spread. Don’t slice the pastel until it has rested for at least 30 minutes to allow the layers to set up for easier slicing and serving.",

    "directions": "Arrange oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).\n\nFor the Braciole: In a medium bowl, add breadcrumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, parsley, pine nuts, olive oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and red pepper flakes and stir until well combined. Set aside.\n\nIf using a top round roast, slice roast into six 1/2 -inch slices. If using pre-sliced beef, skip to Step 5.\n\nLay steak slices 3 inches apart on a cutting board and cover with plastic wrap. Using meat pounder, flatten slices into rough rectangles measuring no more than 1/4 inch thick.\n\nSprinkle both sides of steaks with salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Spread the reserved breadcrumb mixture evenly over steaks, then place 1 slice of prosciutto over each breadcrumb-topped steak, folding prosciutto to fit and pressing firmly into steak. Being careful to keep filling in place and starting from a short end of each steak, roll each steak to form a small bundle. Tie each bundle with 2 pieces of kitchen twine to secure.\n\nFor the Sauce: In a large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add braciole bundles and brown on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer browned braciole to a clean plate; set aside.\n\nAdd onion and salt to the now-empty pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until just fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, and cook until mixture reduces by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and water. Nestle the browned braciole bundles into the sauce and bring the sauce to a simmer.\n\nCover the pan with an oven-safe lid or aluminum foil. Place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Cook, covered, flipping braciole halfway through, for 90 minutes. Carefully remove the lid, flip the braciole again, and continue to cook until the meat is fully tender and sauce thickened to gravy-like consistency, 15 to 45 minutes longer.\n\nSeason sauce with salt to taste. Use scissors to cut off twine around each bundle. Transfer braciole to a large serving platter or individual plates and spoon sauce overtop. Serve.",

    "notes": "I strongly encourage you ask your butcher to slice the beef for you, or use thin pre-sliced top round steaks, sometimes sold as “braciole steaks,” can be found in some supermarkets, Italian grocers, or butchers. If cutting steaks from a top round roast yourself, look for a longer, oval shaped roast to create longer thin steaks for wrapping.",

    "ingredients": "1 pound fresh skinless snapper, bass, halibut or other ocean fish fillets (the fish I listed I like because they have a large flake or meaty texture), cut into ½-inch cubes or slightly smaller\n1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice\n1 medium white onion, chopped into ¼-inch pieces\n2 medium-large (1 pound total) tomatoes, chopped into ¼ inch pieces\nFresh hot green chile to taste (roughly 2 to 3 serranos or 1 to 2 jalapeños), stemmed, seeded and finely chopped\n1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus a few leaves for garnish\n1/3 cup chopped pitted green olives (choose manzanillos for a typical Mexican flavor)\n1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil, preferably extra-virgin (optional but recommended to give a glistening appearance)\nSalt\n3 tablespoons fresh orange juice OR 1/2 teaspoon sugar\n1 large or 2 small ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and diced\nTostadas, tortilla chips or saltine crackers for serving",
    "directions": "**Marinating the fish.**\nIn a 1 ½-quart glass or stainless steel bowl, combine the fish, lime juice and onion. You’ll need enough juice to cover the fish and allow it to float somewhat freely; too little juice means unevenly “cooked” fish. Cover and refrigerate for about 20 minutes, until a cube of fish no longer looks raw when broken open. Pour into a colander and drain off the lime juice (reserving it for a Fishy Michelada Cocktail if you're so inclined).\n\n**The flavorings**. \nIn a large bowl, mix together the tomatoes, green chiles, cilantro, olives and optional olive oil. Stir in the fish, then taste and season with salt, usually about ¾ teaspoon, and orange juice or sugar (the sweetness of the orange juice or sugar helps balance some of the typical tanginess of the ceviche). Cover and refrigerate if not serving immediately.\n\n**Serving the ceviche.** \nJust before serving, stir in the diced avocado, being careful not to break up the pieces. For serving, you have several options: set out your ceviche in a large bowl and let people spoon it onto individual plates to eat with chips or saltines; serve small bowls of ceviche (I like to lay a bed of frisée lettuce in each bowl before spooning in the ceviche) and serve tostadas, chips or saltines alongside; or pile the ceviche onto chips or tostadas and pass around for guests to consume on these edible little plates. Whichever direction you choose, garnish the ceviche with leaves of cilantro before setting it center stage.\n\nWorking ahead: The fish may be marinated a day in advance; after about 4 hours, when the fish is “cooked,” drain it so that it won’t become too limey. For the freshest flavor, add the flavorings to the fish no more than a couple of hours before serving.",

    "directions": "Combine garlic, cilantro, sugar, white pepper, coriander, soy sauce, lemongrass, and half of oil in the bowl of a food processor. Process until a paste is formed, about 1 minute, scraping down sides as necessary. Brush or rub half of mixture over tofu slabs, stacking them in a plastic container or on a plate as you go.\n\n**To Cook on the Grill: **Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place tofu over cooler side of grill at 45-degree angle to the grill grates. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Carefully rotate tofu 90 degrees and continue cooking until bottom side is crisp and has distinct hash marks, about 5 minutes longer. Carefully flip tofu and repeat cooking and rotating steps until crisp on both sides. Continue with step 4 and transfer tofu to a large plate to cool.\n\nTo Cook Under the Broiler: Oil a wire cooling rack and set it in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Arrange tofu slices on top in a single layer. Adjust rack to 6 to 8 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to low (if your oven has two broiler settings, otherwise just preheat the broiler). Broil tofu, turning and rotating every few minutes until crisp and browned on both sides, about 20 minutes total. Continue with step 4 and transfer tofu to a large plate to cool.\n\nWhile tofu cooks, combine remaining marinade with remaining oil in a small bowl. When tofu is cooked, transfer to a large plate or cutting board and, using a brush or the back of a spoon, coat each piece with the remaining marinade. Cut each piece into slices slightly narrower than the baguettes.\n\nPlace baguettes on the cooler side of the grill (or place in oven and immediately shut off broiler if cooking indoors). Cover and cook until heated through and crisp, about 5 minutes. Split baguettes, leaving them hinged on one side. Spread with mayonnaise. Sprinkle bottoms and tops with liquid aminos, then spoon on a thin layer of the ginger-scallion oil if using. Layer with sliced tofu. Add pickled carrot/daikon mixture, cucumber spears, jalapeño, and cilantro. Season to taste with salt, close sandwiches, split in half crosswise (or if using full-sized standard baguettes, cut each into 3 to 4 serving pieces), and serve immediately.",

    "name": "Quadruple Smoked Potatoes",
    "ingredients": "4 large baking potatoes (12 to 14 ounces)\n4 strips artisanal bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slivers\n1 tablespoon bacon fat (from below), melted butter, or extra-virgin olive oil\nCoarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper\nFor the stuffing:\n5 tablespoons butter at room temperature\n4 tablespoons finely chopped scallions\n2 cups coarsely grated smoked cheddar cheese (about 8 ounces)\n1/2 cup sour cream\nPimentón (smoked paprika) for sprinkling",
    "directions": "Step 1: Set up your grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium (350 degrees). Brush and oil the grill grate.\n\nStep 2: Scrub the potatoes on all sides with a vegetable brush. Rinse well and blot dry with paper towels. Prick the potato skin 3 or 4 times with a fork.\n\nStep 3: Cook the bacon: Place it in a cold skillet and fry over medium heat until browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. (You can do this on the grill grate, on a side burner, or on the stovetop.) Transfer the bacon pieces to a large mixing bowl. Leave the bacon fat in the pan.\n\nStep 4: Brush or rub the potato on all sides with the bacon fat and season generously with salt and pepper.\n\nStep 5: Place the potatoes on the grill over the drip pan away from the heat. Toss the wood chips on the coals or place in your gas grill’s smoker box. Smoke-roast the potatoes until tender, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. To test for doneness, pierce a potato through the top with a slender metal or bamboo skewer. It should pierce easily. Transfer the potatoes to a cutting board. Remove from the potato rack, if using.\n\nStep 6: Cut each potato in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scrape out most of the potato flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch thick layer next to the skin. (Note: It’s easier to scoop the potatoes when they are hot. Insulated food gloves will protect your hands.) Very roughly chop the scooped potato and place in the mixing bowl with the bacon.\n\nStep 7: Add the 4 tablespoons butter, the scallions, and 1-1/2 cups grated cheese and gently stir to mix. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the sour cream and salt and pepper to taste: The mixture should be highly seasoned. Stir as little as possible so as to leave some texture to the potatoes.\n\nStep 8: Stuff the potato mixture back into the potato skins, mounding it in the center. Sprinkle each potato with the remaining cheese and top with a thin slice of butter (from the remaining 1 tablespoon). Sprinkle each stuffed potato with pimentón. The potatoes can be prepared up to 24 hours ahead to this stage, covered and refrigerated.\n\nStep 9: Just before serving, reheat the potatoes on your grill until browned and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes, or as needed. (If the potatoes have been refrigerated, allow 25 to 30 minutes for reheating.)",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "If you like smoke, you’re going to love these smoked potatoes. The flavor comes at you from all directions—smoky bacon, smoked cheddar cheese, pimentón (Spanish smoked paprika), and of course, smoke-roasting the whole potatoes on the grill.\n\nNote: You can certainly smoke the potatoes in a smoker. I prefer indirect grilling with wood smoke—the higher temperature gives you crisper skin.",

With a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the cod to a platter, cover it and set it aside to continue cooking in its own residual heat.\n\nAdd the olives, capers, horseradish and sour cream to the pan and bring to a boil.\n\nArrange a cod fillet on each of 4 plates and top with the sauce. Sprinkle the cilantro over. Serve immediately.",

    "name": "Pommes De Terre Fondantes (Fondant Potatoes)",
    "ingredients": "1 1/2 cups homemade chicken or beef stock, or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth, plus extra as needed\n1/4 ounce (2 1/2 teaspoons; 1 packet; 7 g) unflavored gelatin, such as Knox\n2 1/2 pounds (1.1 kg) Yukon Gold potatoes, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long each, peeled\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons (30 ml) vegetable oil, beef fat, schmaltz, or duck fat (see note)\n4 tablespoons (55 g) unsalted butter\n3 medium garlic cloves (15 g), peeled and smashed\n1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped\nFlaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for finishing (optional)",
    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Place stock in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over top. Set aside.\n\nVicky Wasik\n\nUsing a sharp knife, cut off ends of potatoes to give them flat sides, then halve potatoes crosswise. Pat dry with paper towels.\n\nIn a 12-inch stainless steel straight-sided sauté pan or skillet, or cast iron skillet, heat oil or fat over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Season potatoes with salt and pepper and add to skillet, broad side down, in a single layer with space between each piece. Cook, without moving, until potatoes begin to brown around edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, rotating and swirling pan gently to promote even browning and prevent sticking, until potatoes are deeply browned on bottom side, 3 to 4 minutes longer, adjusting heat as needed if some of the pieces brown too quickly.\n\nUsing a thin metal spatula, flip potatoes onto second flat side. Add butter and cook, swirling constantly, until butter is melted and begins to foam, about 1 minute. Add garlic and thyme, and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add stock and bring to a boil.\n\nTransfer skillet to oven and roast until potatoes are completely tender, offering little to no resistance when poked with a paring knife, and liquid is reduced to a saucy consistency, 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nReturn skillet to stovetop. Using a thin metal spatula or tongs, transfer potatoes to a serving platter, broad side up, leaving sauce in the skillet; discard garlic. Bring sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook, swirling and stirring constantly, until sauce is emulsified, 30 seconds to 1 minute. If emulsion appears broken or sauce is too thick, add more stock or water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper and pour sauce over and around potatoes. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt (if using, otherwise season with a little more kosher salt), and serve.\n\nVicky Wasik\n\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately, but leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat with additional stock, up to 1/4 cup (60ml), to loosen and then re-emulsify the sauce.",

    "directions": "First, prep the vegetables, mixing them together in a bowl. \n\nStem and finely chop 1 large fresh serrano or 1 small fresh jalapeño chile.\n\nTwist off a small handful of cilantro (where the leaves begin) and, holding it tightly bunched, thinly slice across the leaves and tender upper stems. \n\nFinely dice 1/2 of a small white onion, scoop into a strainer and run under cold water for 30 seconds or so to “deflame” it; shake off the excess water and measure 1/3 cup.\n\nChop 1 small ripe tomato into ¼-inch bits (to ensure they won’t soften the avocado with too much moisture, we let the tomato drain for a few minutes in a strainer).\n\nIn a large bowl, coarsely mash the flesh of 3 ripe avocados (together they should weigh 1 to 1 ¼ pounds before they’re cut): cut the avocados in half around the pit from top to bottom and back up again, twist the halves in opposite directions, pull them apart, scoop out the pits, scoop the flesh from each half). The mashing implement is important: to create thick, “meaty” guacamole, use a large fork or old-fashioned potato or bean masher. \n\nGently stir in the vegetables, remembering that you don’t have to use them all if it looks like they’re going to take focus away from the avocado. Taste what you have, then **start the restrained addition of lime**:  it usually takes a tablespoon or two of fresh-squeezed lime juice to heighten the avocado flavor without screaming “lime juice!” I can assure you that it’ll take about 1 teaspoon salt to harmonize the avocado with the other flavors—any less will leave the avocado flavor wandering in the wilderness.",

    "directions": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nWe prefer to use a cast-iron skillet here because it makes the best crust; however, any 10-inch ovensafe skillet will work for this recipe. Cornbread is best served warm.\n\nAdjust oven racks to lower-middle and middle positions and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place 10-inch cast-iron skillet on middle rack and heat for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, spread cornmeal over rimmed baking sheet and toast in oven on lower-middle rack until fragrant and lightly golden, about 5 minutes.\n\nCarefully transfer toasted cornmeal to large bowl and whisk in sour cream and milk; set aside. When skillet is hot, add oil and continue to heat until just smoking, about 5 minutes.\n\nUsing potholders (skillet handle will be hot), remove skillet from oven, carefully add butter, and gently swirl to incorporate. Pour hot oil-butter mixture into cornmeal mixture and whisk to incorporate. Whisk in sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, followed by eggs.\n\nQuickly scrape batter into hot skillet and smooth top. Bake on middle rack until top begins to crack and sides are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes, rotating skillet halfway through baking. Let bread cool in skillet on wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove bread from pan and let cool on rack for at least 10 minutes before serving.",

    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nBuffalo wings are a messy finger food but a definite crowd-pleaser. To make a more party-friendly version, we turned them into a dip with all the same lip-tingling, tangy flavor but with easier access and less mess. Shredding the meat from a rotisserie chicken kept the dip quick to assemble. Cream cheese provided a smooth base for the dip, and microwaving it with Frank’s RedHot Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce loosened it so that stirring in chunky ingredients (chicken and blue cheese) was a snap. A cup of ranch dressing, a couple of teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, and a sprinkling of cheddar cheese and scallions heightened the dip’s zesty tang.",

    "name": "Slow-Cooker Chicken Chasseur",
    "ingredients": "8 ounces bacon (about 8 slices), chopped fine\n12 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (5 to 6 ounces each), trimmed of any yellow or white fat (see note)\nSalt and ground black pepper\nVegetable oil, as needed\n1 1/4 pounds cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and quartered (see note)\n1 medium red onion, chopped medium\n4 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 4 teaspoons)\n1 1/2 cups dry white wine\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained\n2 cups low-sodium chicken broth\n1/4 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed and minced\n1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried\n2 bay leaves\n1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: A successful slow-cooker chicken chasseur recipe required that the chicken, vegetables, and flavorings be browned on the stovetop before they were transferred to the slow cooker to simmer. We found that about four hours on the cooker’s lowest setting produced the best results. For our slow-cooker chicken chasseur recipe, bone-in, skin-on thighs tasted best, though we did find it important to remove the skin once the pieces were browned (when they were left on, the broth turned greasy). \n\nChicken chasseur is a simple, peasant-style braise enriched by the deep, woodsy flavors of mushrooms and bacon. If cremini mushrooms (aka baby bellas) are unavailable, substitute portobello mushroom caps, cut into 1-inch pieces. Although we prefer the texture and flavor of chicken thighs here, you can substitute 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts; the cooking time will remain the same, but the meat will be a bit drier. This dish is great served with pasta, polenta, or a loaf of crusty bread.\n\n1. Cook the bacon in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Add the bacon to the slow cooker, leaving the bacon fat in the pan.\n\n2. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from the pan (add vegetable oil to equal 2 tablespoons if needed) and heat over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown half of the chicken on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side, reducing the heat if the pan begins to scorch. Transfer the chicken to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan. When cool enough to handle, remove the browned skin from the thighs and discard. Transfer the chicken to the slow cooker. Return the pan with the fat to medium-high heat and repeat with the remaining half of the chicken.\n\n3. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from the pan. (Add additional vegetable oil to equal 1 tablespoon if needed.) Add the cremini mushrooms, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have released their liquid, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the wine and tomato paste, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Pour into the slow cooker.\n\n4. Add the tomatoes, 1 1/2 cups of the broth, the porcini mushrooms, thyme, bay leaves, and pepper flakes to the slow cooker. Cover and cook on low until the chicken is tender, about 4 hours.\n\n5. Transfer the chicken to a large serving dish and tent loosely with foil. Discard the bay leaves. Set the slow cooker to high. Whisk the remaining 1/2 cup broth and the flour together until smooth, then stir into the slow cooker. Cover and continue to cook until the sauce is thickened and no longer tastes of flour, 15 to 30 minutes longer.\n\n6. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the vegetables and some of the sauce over the chicken and serve, passing the remaining sauce separately.",

    "ingredients": "1 1/2 pounds 93 percent lean ground beef\n2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons water\nSalt and pepper\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n1/2 cup milk\n1 large egg yolk\n8 scallions, green parts only, sliced thin\n2 teaspoons vegetable oil\n1 onion, chopped\n4 ounces white mushrooms, trimmed and chopped\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n2 tablespoons Madeira or ruby port\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1 1/4 cups beef broth\n2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\n2 sprigs fresh thyme\n1 bay leaf\n2 carrots, peeled and chopped\n2 teaspoons cornstarch",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: The traditional version of this dish of meat and gravy topped with mashed potatoes is time-consuming to make, and the end product is a bit heavy for modern palates. We streamlined the process by building and serving the pie in one skillet and by using lean ground beef rather than braised chunks of meat. To keep the meat tender, we treated it with baking soda, which raised the pH and kept the proteins from bonding too tightly, and we simmered the meat in the gravy rather than seared it. To replace the browned meat flavors that usually form the basis of the sauce, we sautéed the onions, mushrooms, and tomato paste in the skillet until quite dark, and then we deglazed the pan with fortified wine.\n\n1. Toss beef with 2 tablespoons water, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and baking soda in bowl until thoroughly combined. Set aside for 20 minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, place potatoes in medium saucepan; add water to just cover and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are soft and tip of paring knife inserted into potato meets no resistance, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and return to saucepan. Return saucepan to low heat and cook, shaking pot occasionally, until any surface moisture on potatoes has evaporated, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat and mash potatoes well. Stir in melted butter. Whisk together milk and egg yolk in small bowl, then stir into potatoes. Stir in scallion greens and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and set aside.\n3. Heat oil in broiler-safe 10-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just starting to soften and dark bits form on bottom of skillet, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic; cook until bottom of skillet is dark brown, about 2 minutes. Add Madeira and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until evaporated, about 1 minute. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Add broth, Worcestershire, thyme, bay leaf, and carrots; bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low, add beef in 2-inch chunks to broth, and bring to gentle simmer. Cover and cook until beef is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring and breaking up meat chunks with 2 forks halfway through. Stir cornstarch and remaining 2 teaspoons water together in bowl. Stir cornstarch mixture into filling and continue to simmer for 30 seconds. Remove thyme and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n4. Adjust oven rack 5 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Place mashed potatoes in large zipper-lock bag and snip off 1 corner to create 1-inch opening. Pipe potatoes in even layer over filling, making sure to cover entire surface. Smooth potatoes with back of spoon, then use tines of fork to make ridges over surface. Place skillet on rimmed baking sheet and broil until potatoes are golden brown and crusty and filling is bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.",

    "ingredients": "2 lb. baby Yukon Gold or Red Bliss potatoes (20 to 25 potatoes, 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 inches in diameter)\n1 sprig fresh rosemary\n2 cups homemade or low-salt chicken broth\n2 Tbs. good-quality extra-virgin olive oil\n1 Tbs. unsalted butter\n1 teaspoon kosher salt (less if the broth is salty)\n1 to 2 Tbs. thinly sliced fresh chives\nFleur de sel or other sea salt for serving (optional)",
    "directions": "Trim the potatoes of any eyes or damaged areas and wash well in cold water. Arrange as many potatoes as will fit in one layer in a 10-inch nonstick skillet (there should be a little room to spare; save any extra potatoes for another use). Add the rosemary, broth, oil, butter, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan but leave the lid a tad ajar, and boil until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, **about 20 min**. The liquid should still halfway surround the potatoes; if it doesn’t, add more broth or water until it does\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and press on each potato with a 1/4-cup measure just until it cracks open. Set the pan over **medium-high heat** and cook, uncovered, until all the liquid has evaporated and the potatoes have browned on one side, about 10 min. Gently turn the potatoes and brown the other side, another 4 to 5 min.\n\nPress firmly on the potatoes to crack them; this helps them absorb more broth and ensures a creamy, moist interior. Then continue boiling, but now uncovered.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and let the potatoes rest for 5 min. before transferring them to a serving platter. Sprinkle with the chives and serve immediately, passing the fleur de sel so diners can sprinkle some on if they want.",

    "directions": "In a small bowl, whisk the lemon zest, lemon juice, honey, and 1/4 cup of olive oil. Add the garlic cloves and let them steep for about 30 minutes. \n\nNext, bring the veggie stock to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in the couscous, cover, and turn off the heat; allow the couscous to sit for about 5 minutes, or until it absorbs all the liquid. Toss the couscous with a fork so the grains don’t start clumping together, pour into a large mixing bowl, and set aside. \n\nIn a skillet over medium high heat, add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then, add the chopped squash and zucchini, shallot, sultanas, pistachios and a pinch or two of salt. Only cook for about a minute or two — you still want the squash and zucchini to be al dente. This just ensures they aren’t too al dente, and all the flavors can marry before they hit the couscous. Set aside until everything reaches room temperature. \n\nOnce the veggies have reached room temperature, add them to the bowl with the couscous and combine.\n\nThen, remove and discard the cloves of garlic from the dressing, and toss it with the couscous (add the dressing gradually, as you may not need it all). Fold in the mint, season with additional salt and pepper if necessary and serve at room temperature.\n\n",

We built in flavor from the beginning by toasting our garlic low and slow until the natural sugars created sticky, almost candy-like flavor. When the pasta was nearly ready, we uncovered the skillet and reduced the liquid, which melded with the starch from the pasta resulting in a luscious sauce that coated the noodles perfectly. Lots of lemon, savory Parmesan, and crunchy pine nuts transformed this quick weeknight meal into a sophisticated dish you’ll be making time and time again.",

    "ingredients": "1 cup best-quality red wine vinegar \n2 to 3 garlic cloves, minced (about 2 tablespoons) \n3 sprigs of fresh rosemary, chopped (about 1 tablespoon)\n5 1/2 pounds bone-in chicken pieces (each part should be cut in half) Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper \nExtra-virgin olive oil \n3 1/4 cup chicken broth, plus more as needed\n",
    "directions": "At least 15 minutes but up to 2 hours before cooking, combine the vinegar, garlic, and rosemary to marinate.\n\n2. Thoroughly season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Heat a 14-inch skillet (or two smaller skillets) over high heat and swirl in enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the skillet. \n\n3. Place the chicken in the skillet, skin side down. Don't crowd the chicken; leave space around each piece. Work in batches if necessary. You should hear an immediate sizzle when the chicken pieces hit the pan. Don't move them; it takes a couple minutes to sear the chicken so it doesn't stick. Brown all sides; this will take 10 minutes per batch. Regulate the heat so it stays high but does not burn the chicken.\n\n4. Place all the browned chicken back in the skillet.\n\n5. Add the chicken broth and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.\nLower the heat, simmer, and reduce for 15 to 20 minutes. \n\n6. Increase the heat to high and pour in the vinegar mixture. Swirl the pan and stir around as the vinegar evaporates to form a simmering glaze, 8 to 10 minutes.\n\nServe immediately or reheat with some extra broth. \n\nPolenta\nA staple of northern Italian cooking, polenta is boiled cornmeal It's traditionally slow-cooked and requires constant stirring But the modern-style instant polenta that's readily available at grocery stores works better for time-pressed home cooking Once cooked, polenta firms up as it cools, so it can be shaped or molded and then sliced and reheated at mealtime Pour the loose hot polenta into a greased loaf pan, smooth the top with a spoon, cover, and chill. When ready to serve, slice the polenta, panfry the shoes in olive oil or warm them in the oven or microwave.The hot polenta also can be poured into a greased rimmed baking sheet, spread evenly, covered, and chilled. When it is set, it can be cut into shapes with round, square, or diamond shaped biscuit cutters Many stores also carry a pre-made log of polenta, in the dairy case, ready to be sliced and heated\n\n",

    "directions": "In a blender, combine the shredded coconut and warm water. Let stand until the coconut begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Blend on high until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the mixture into a fine-mesh sieve set over a large saucepan. Press on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids.\n\nUsing a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the limes in strips; remove only the colored portion, not the white pith beneath. You will need a total of about 10 strips, each 2 to 3 inches long; add them to the saucepan. Juice the limes; you will need 3 tablespoons; set aside.\n\nTo the saucepan, add the coconut cream, coconut water, lemon grass, ginger, shallot, turmeric, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon white pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high, then reduce to low and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard the solids.\n\nFor oyster mushrooms, tear them into bite-size pieces. For shiitakes, stem and thinly slice them. Stir the mushrooms, then bring to a simmer over medium. Add the chicken, fish sauce, chili paste, sugar and ⅛ teaspoon white pepper. Simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the chicken is opaque throughout and the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in the lime juice and sliced chili. Taste and season with salt or fish sauce and white pepper. Serve sprinkled with cilantro.",

Mix all ingredients together in bowl.\n\n4) Let bean/grain mixture rest for about 15-20 minutes before forming into patties. Roll mixture into 2 1/2- to 3-oz balls (a little less than 1/4 cup) and flatten into 1/2-inch-thick patties.\n\n5) Pan cook in a teeny bit of oil or cooking spray for 5–7 minutes on each side; or bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes. Either way, the outside gets a little crispy and the inside is nice and chewy, but not dry.\n\n6) Serve with whole grain bread and your favorite condiments, like spicy mustard or peanut butter and American cheese. These burgers rock with sweet potato fries.\n\n",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "Examine mussels before using. If they're gritty or have lots of beards (it'll look like bits of hair coming out from between their shells), scrub them well under cold water and pull out the beards by grabbing them and pulling towards the hinge-end of the mussels. Farm-raised mussels are generally quite clean when they are sold.\n\nDiscard cracked mussels or open mussels that don't close when tapped with another mussel.\n\nMayonnaise is not essential for this dish, but it does add extra richness and lots of flavor, particularly if served alongside for dipping mussels into. When using mayonnaise for this dish, be sure to use fresh homemade mayonnaise—store-bought mayonnaise will not combine with the sauce properly. I like to add extra garlic and substitute half of the canola oil for extra-virgin olive oil when making mayonnaise for mussels.",

    "name": "Smothered Pork Chops",
    "ingredients": "1 teaspoon onion powder\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\nSalt and pepper\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n4 bone-in blade-cut pork chops, about 1/2 inch thick\n1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n2 onions, halved and sliced 1/4 inch thick\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n1/4 teaspoon dried thyme\n3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon beef broth\n1 bay leaf\n1 teaspoon cornstarch\n1 teaspoon cider vinegar",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Bone-in chops were a must for our Smothered Pork Chops, because the bone kept the meat moist and added flavor to the sauce. After a number of tests, we settled on blade chops. Caramelizing the onions made the sauce too sweet and took almost an hour. We had better luck cooking them in butter until they were lightly browned. We swapped out chicken broth in favor of meatier beef broth, which greatly improved the flavor of our sauce. Adding dried thyme, bay leaf, and cider vinegar bumped up the flavor even more.\n\n1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine onion powder, paprika, ½ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, and cayenne in small bowl. Pat chops dry with paper towels and rub with spice mixture.\n\n2. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown chops, 3 to 4 minutes per side, and transfer to plate. Melt butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Cook onions until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in ¾ cup broth and bay leaf, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to boil. Return chops and any accumulated juices to pan, cover, and transfer to oven. Cook until chops are completely tender, about 1½ hours.\n\n3. Transfer chops to platter and tent with foil. Discard bay leaf. Strain contents of skillet through fine mesh strainer into large liquid measuring cup; reserve onions. Let liquid settle, then skim fat. Return 1½ cups defatted pan juices to now-empty skillet and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce is reduced to 1 cup, about 5 minutes.\n\n4. Whisk remaining broth and cornstarch in bowl until no lumps remain. Whisk cornstarch mixture into sauce and simmer until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in reserved onions and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Serve.",

    "name": "Red Tomato Rice",
    "ingredients": "1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes (I prefer fire-roasted), lightly drained OR 12 ounces (2 medium-small round or 4 to 6 plum) very ripe tomatoes, cored and roughly chopped\n1/2 small white onion, roughly chopped\n2 garlic cloves, peeled and halved\n1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n1 1/2 cups white rice, preferably medium-grain\n1 3/4 cups chicken broth or water\nFresh hot green chile to taste (roughly 3 serranos or 2 jalapeños), a slit cut down the length of each one\nAbout 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley\nsalt",
    "directions": "Make the tomato flavoring. In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatoes (drained canned or chopped raw) with the onion and garlic. Blend to a smooth puree.\n\nFry the raw rice. In a medium (3-quart) saucepan with a tight fitting lid (one that’s about 8 inches in diameter is perfect for even cooking), heat the oil over medium. Add the raw rice and stir frequently until the kernels have turned from translucent to milky white, 5 to 6 minutes—it is fine for some browning to take place. Add the tomato mixture, stir around a couple of times, then let cook until reduced and somewhat dry-looking, 2 to 3 minutes.\n\nSimmer the rice. Add the broth or water, bring to a full boil, then add the chiles, parsley and the salt, about ¾ teaspoon if using lightly salted broth, 1½ teaspoons if using unsalted broth or water. Stir thoroughly, scraping down any rice kernels clinging to the side of the pan. Cover and cook over lowest heat for 17 minutes—the temperature should be low enough that only the slightest hint of steam escapes from the lid. At 17 minutes, the rice should be tender. Use a fork to gently fluff the rice to release the steam and stop the cooking. Recover and let stand a few minutes longer for the starch in the rice to firm. You’re ready to serve. You may remove the chiles if you wish, or pull them out to use as decoration on top of the rice.",

    "ingredients": "2 1/4 pounds (1kg) Yukon Gold potatoes\nKosher salt\n3 fresh thyme sprigs\n1/4 pound (115g) slab or thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/4-inch lardons\n1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30g) unsalted butter, only if needed\n2 medium (8-ounce; 225g) yellow onions, thinly sliced\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 cup (120ml) dry white wine\n1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream or crème fraîche\n1 pound (450g) Reblochon-style soft-rind cheese (see headnote for suggested cheeses)",
    "directions": "Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch thick rounds. In a large pot, cover potatoes with cold water. Season generously with salt, add thyme, and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Cook at a bare simmer until potatoes are just tender and can be easily pierced with a paring knife, about 25 minutes. Discard thyme, drain potatoes, return to pot, and set aside.\n\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). In a 10-inch cast iron or stainless-steel skillet, heat bacon over medium-high heat until fat begins to render. Lower heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until fat is mostly rendered and bacon is cooked but not crisp, about 5 minutes. If there is excessive rendered fat, drain off all but 1/4 cup (60ml); conversely, if the bacon is lean and didn't release much fat, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30g) butter. Add onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions have softened but not browned, about 8 minutes.\n\nAdd white wine and cook, stirring, until wine has almost fully cooked off, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape bacon-onion mixture into pot with potatoes and toss gently to thoroughly combine.\n\nScrape potato mixture back into cast-iron skillet or into a 3-quart (3L) baking dish. Add cream or crème fraîche (the latter is thicker, so you can dollop it around in that case).\n\nCut cheese into roughly 1/2-inch-thick slabs. You can do this by cutting the cheese wheels in half to make half-moons; halve wheels through the equator; or slice crosswise into thick planks. Arrange cheese on top of potatoes, rind side up. Set skillet or baking dish on top of a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling and lightly browned on top, about 40 minutes.\n\nServe, scooping tartiflette from the skillet or baking dish onto individual serving plates.",

    "directions": "Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 500 degrees. Grease a rimmed baking sheet with the appropriate oil and place the trout on the sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart. Season the cavity of each fish with salt and pepper. Using a spoon, divide the filling equally among the cavities of the fish.\n\nPlace the baking sheet in the oven and cook until the fish is opaque and the meat flakes upon touch, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve immediately, 1 trout per diner, garnished with a lemon wedge.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "The filling may be made up to 2 days ahead of time, but the fish should be stuffed and roasted at the last minute. With either filling, the trout pairs well with the bulgur and quinoa pilafs. Use olive oil to grease the baking sheet if using the fennel stuffing; vegetable oil works better with the bacon stuffing. Ask your fishmonger to gut and clean the fish.",

    "name": "Chocolate-Espresso Dacquoise",
    "ingredients": "**MERINGUE**\n¾ cup blanched sliced almonds, toasted\n½ cup hazelnuts, toasted and skinned\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n⅛ teaspoon salt\n1 cup (7 ounces) sugar\n4 large egg whites, room temperature\n¼ teaspoon cream of tartar\n\n**BUTTERCREAM**\n¾ cup whole milk\n4 large egg yolks\n⅓ cup (2 1/3 ounces) sugar\n1 ½ teaspoons cornstarch\n¼ teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons amaretto or water\n1 ½ tablespoons instant espresso powder\n16 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n\n**GANACHE**\n6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine\n¾ cup heavy cream\n2 teaspoons corn syrup\n12 whole hazelnuts, toasted and skinned\n1 cup blanched sliced almonds, toasted",
    "directions": "1. FOR THE MERINGUE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Using ruler and pencil, draw 13 by 10 1/2-inch rectangle on piece of parchment paper. Grease baking sheet and place parchment on it, ink side down.\n\n2. Process almonds, hazelnuts, cornstarch, and salt in food processor until nuts are finely ground, 15 to 20 seconds. Add 1/2 cup sugar and pulse to combine, 1 to 2 pulses.\n\n3. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. With mixer running at medium-high speed, slowly add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue to whip until glossy, stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold nut mixture into egg whites in 2 batches. With offset spatula, spread meringue evenly into 13 by 10 1/2-inch rectangle on parchment, using lines on parchment as guide. Using spray bottle, evenly mist surface of meringue with water until glistening. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off oven and allow meringue to cool in oven for 1 1/2 hours. (Do not open oven during baking and cooling.) Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. (Cooled meringue can be kept at room temperature, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 days.)\n\n4. FOR THE BUTTERCREAM: Heat milk in small saucepan over medium heat until just simmering. Meanwhile, whisk yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in bowl until smooth. Remove milk from heat and, whisking constantly, add half of milk to yolk mixture to temper. Whisking constantly, return tempered yolk mixture to remaining milk in saucepan. Return saucepan to medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is bubbling and thickens to consistency of warm pudding, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer pastry cream to bowl. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Before using, warm gently to room temperature in microwave at 50 percent power, stirring every 10 seconds.\n\n5. Stir together amaretto and espresso powder; set aside. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter at medium speed until smooth and light, 3 to 4 minutes. Add pastry cream in 3 batches, beating for 30 seconds after each addition. Add amaretto mixture and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes longer, scraping down bowl thoroughly halfway through mixing.\n\n6. FOR THE GANACHE: Place chocolate in heatproof bowl. Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Pour cream mixture over chocolate and let stand for 1 minute. Stir mixture until smooth. Set aside to cool until chocolate mounds slightly when dripped from spoon, about 5 minutes.\n\n7. Carefully invert meringue and peel off parchment. Reinvert meringue and place on cutting board. Using serrated knife and gentle, repeated scoring motion, trim edges of meringue to form 12 by 10-inch rectangle. Discard trimmings. With long side of rectangle parallel to counter, use ruler to mark both long edges of meringue at 3-inch intervals. Using serrated knife, score surface of meringue by drawing knife toward you from mark on top edge to corresponding mark on bottom edge. Repeat scoring until meringue is fully cut through. Repeat until you have four 10 by 3-inch rectangles. (If any meringues break during cutting, use them as middle layers.)\n\n8. Place 3 rectangles on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Using offset spatula, spread 1/4 cup ganache evenly over surface of each meringue. Refrigerate until ganache is firm, about 15 minutes. Set aside remaining ganache.\n\n9. Using offset spatula, spread top of remaining rectangle with 1/2 cup buttercream; place on wire rack with ganache-coated meringues. Invert 1 ganache-coated meringue, place on top of buttercream, and press gently to level. Repeat, spreading meringue with 1/2 cup buttercream and topping with inverted ganache-coated meringue. Spread top with buttercream. Invert final ganache-coated strip on top of cake. Use 1 hand to steady top of cake and spread half of remaining buttercream to lightly coat sides of cake, then use remaining buttercream to coat top of cake. Smooth until cake resembles box. Refrigerate until buttercream is firm, about 2 hours. (Once buttercream is firm, assembled cake may be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.)\n\n10. Warm remaining ganache in heatproof bowl set over barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until mixture is very fluid but not hot. Keeping assembled cake on wire rack, pour ganache over top of cake. Using offset spatula, spread ganache in thin, even layer over top of cake, letting excess flow down sides. Spread ganache over sides in thin layer (top must be completely covered, but some small gaps on sides are OK).\n\n11. Garnish top of cake with hazelnuts. Holding bottom of cake with 1 hand, gently press almonds onto sides with other hand. Chill on wire rack, uncovered, for at least 3 hours or up to 12 hours. Transfer to platter. Cut into slices with sharp knife that has been dipped in hot water and wiped dry before each slice. Serve.",
    "description": "We made this elaborate and impressive-looking dessert more approachable by reworking the meringue and buttercream, making them simpler and more foolproof. We swapped the traditional individually piped layers of meringue for a single sheet that was trimmed into layers after baking, and we shortened the usual 4-plus hours of oven time by increasing the oven temperature. While many recipes call for a Swiss or French buttercream made with a hot sugar syrup, we opted for a German buttercream. With equal parts pastry cream and butter, this option required no hot syrup and it enabled us to use up the egg yolks left over from the meringue.",

    "ingredients": "2 (1-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1 ¼ teaspoons vegetable oil\n½ teaspoon pepper\n¼ teaspoon baking soda\n1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan",
    "directions": "\nWe prefer natural pork, but if you use enhanced pork (injected with a salt solution), reduce the salt in step 2 to 1 1/2 teaspoons. A 3-inch-deep aluminum roasting pan is essential. Do not attempt this recipe with a drawer broiler. We set the rack 4 to 5 inches from the element for the best results for this recipe.\n\n1. Adjust oven rack 4 to 5 inches from broiler element and heat oven to 325 degrees. Fold thin tip of each tenderloin under about 2 inches to create uniformly shaped roast. Tie tenderloins crosswise with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals, making sure folded tip is secured underneath. Trim excess twine close to meat to prevent it from scorching under broiler.\n\n2. Mix salt, oil, and pepper in small bowl until salt is evenly coated with oil. Add baking soda and stir until well combined. Rub mixture evenly over pork. Place tenderloins in disposable pan, evenly spaced between sides of pan and each other.\n\n3. Turn oven to broil. Immediately place meat in oven and broil tenderloins for 5 minutes. Flip tenderloins and continue to broil until golden brown and meat registers 125 to 130 degrees, 8 to 14 minutes. Remove disposable pan from oven, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove twine, slice tenderloins into 1/2-inch-thick slices, and serve.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nRecipes for broiled pork tenderloin promise roasts with well-browned exteriors and rosy-pink, juicy centers, but the results are more likely pallid, overcooked meat or spottily browned roasts with undercooked interiors. Using a disposable aluminum pan to cook the pork reflected the radiant heat of the broiler toward the pork, enhancing browning and ensuring that the interior didn’t overcook by the time deep browning had been achieved. Since some ovens preheat faster than others and are likely to cycle off if preheated at such an intense heat for too long, we evened the playing field by preheating the oven to 325 degrees before putting in the roasts and turning on the broiler. And finally, because of the broiler’s intense heat, we found that there was a much bigger carryover cooking effect, so we pulled the roasts from the oven when they hit 125 to 130 degrees instead of our usual 140 degrees to ensure that they were a perfect medium-rare after their 10-minute rest.",

    "directions": "Adjust rack to center position and heat oven to 450.°\n\nMix first 3 ingredients in a large bowl or the workbowl of a food processor fitted with steel blade. Add butter; with your fingertips, a pastry blender, 2 knives, or steel blade of a food processor, mix, cut, or process butter and shortening into dry ingredients, until the mixture resembles dry oatmeal. (Transfer food processor mixture to a large bowl.)\n\nStir in milk with a rubber spatula or fork until dry ingredients are just moistened. Let dough rest for 1 minute, then transfer it to a well-floured work surface.\n\nRoll the dough into a rough 6-by-10-inch rectangle. With the long edge of the dough facing you, fold in both short ends of the dough so that they meet in the center; then fold the dough in half by width, forming a package of dough four layers thick. Once again, roll the dough into a 6-by-10-inch rectangle 1/2-inch thick.\n\nUsing a lightly greased and floured 2-inch cutter, stamp, with one decisive punch per round, 4 rows of 3 dough rounds, cutting them close together to generate as few scraps as possible. Dip cutter into flour before each new cut. Push the scraps of dough together so that their edges join; firmly pinch the edges with fingertips to make a partial seal. Pat the dough into small rectangle, fold it as before, and re-roll 1/2-inch thick. Cut out 3 or 4 more biscuits.\n\nPlace dough rounds 1 1/2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet; brush dough tops with melted butter or milk. (May be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 3 hours.)\n\nBake until biscuits are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve immediately.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "After stirring in the milk, this dough should feel very soft and moist, but you should be able to hold it briefly between lightly floured hands without its sticking. If it turns out wet and sticky, return it to the bowl and sprinkle it with 2 to 4 tablespoons additional flour (of any kind) on all sides, gently patting in the flour with your palm. Let the dough rest another half-minute before removing it to your work surface. It is best to discard the dough that is left over from the second cutting, as biscuits made with thrice-recycled dough tend to be tough and flat. These biscuits are best served at once, though leftovers may be wrapped and refrigerated for a day, then reheated for a few minutes in a 350° oven.",

    "name": "Brazilian Style Rib Roast Stuffed with Sausage and Cheese",
    "ingredients": "\n\n\n",
    "directions": "Using a long slender carving knife, make a 1-inch lengthwise cut through the center of the roast.  Cut one end off two of the chorizos.  Cut both ends off the third chorizo.  Insert the chorizos into the hole you’ve made in the roast, butting the ends of the sausages so they fit snugly.  (Insert the uncut end of chorizo first, followed by the chorizo with two cuts, and lastly, insert the third chorizo, cut end first.)\n\nUsing a sharpening steel (wipe it with a paper towel before using),\n\nmake lengthwise tunnels through the roast around the sausage and insert the carrots and cheese strips.  You may need to insert more than  1 strip of cheese per tunnel.  Cut off the ends of the sausages, carrots, and cheese, leaving 1/2-inch protruding.\n\nMake the rub: Combine the paprika, salt, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl and stir to mix.  Sprinkle this mixture all over the roast, rubbing it onto the meat with your fingers.  Let the roast sit while you preheat the grill.\n\nSkewer the roast on the spit (remember to put the first set of prongs on first), tightening the prongs to hold it securely.\n\n(Use the tines of a fork to tighten the flat screw on the prongs.)\n\nSet up the grill for rotisserie grilling following the manufacturer’s instructions and preheat to medium-high.  Place a large drip pan underneath the spit to catch the meat drippings.  When ready to cook, attach the spit to the rotisserie motor mechanism by inserting the pointed end of the spit into the rotisserie’s motor socket.  If your rotisserie spit has a counterweight, position it so that it counterbalances the roast.  Turn on the motor and spit roast the rib roast until the outside is crusty and handsomely browned and the inside is cooked to taste, about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours for medium-rare.  An instant-read meat thermometer should read about 145 degrees.\n\nCarefully remove the roast from the spit and transfer to a carving board.  Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before thinly slicing it crosswise with a sharp carving knife.  (Makes sure each slice includes a piece of chorizo.)\n\n",

Refrigerate at least 30 minutes. (Can be refrigerated up to 3 days ahead.)\n\nIn 5-quart pot or Dutch oven fitted with clip-on-the-pot candy thermometer, or in larger electric fryer, heat oil over medium-low heat to 325 degrees. As oil heats, add bacon grease. Oil will bubble up when you add fries, so be sure you have at least 3 inches of room at top of cooking pot.\n\nPour off ice and water, quickly wrap potatoes in a clean tea towel, and thoroughly pat dry. Increase heat to medium-high and add fries, a handful at a time, to hot oil. Fry, stirring with Chinese skimmer or large-hole slotted spoon, until potatoes are limp and soft and start to turn from white to blond, 6 to 8 minutes. (Oil temperature will drop 50 to 60 degrees during this frying.) Use skimmer or slotted spoon to transfer fries to brown paper bag to drain; let rest at least 10 minutes (can stand at room temperature up to 2 hours or be wrapped in paper towels, sealed in zipper-lock bag, and frozen up to 1 month).\n\nWhen ready to serve fries, reheat oil to 350 degrees. Using paper bag as a funnel, pour potatoes into hot oil. Discard bag and set up second paper bag. Fry potatoes, stirring fairly constantly, until golden brown and puffed, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper bag and drain again. Season to taste with salt and pepper, or other seasoned salt. Serve immediately.",

    "name": "Tender, Juicy Grilled Burgers",
    "ingredients": "1 ½ pounds sirloin steak tips, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch chunks\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces\nKosher salt and pepper\n1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum pan (if using charcoal)\n4 hamburger buns",
    "directions": "This recipe requires freezing the meat twice, for a total of 65 to 80 minutes, before grilling. When stirring the salt and pepper into the ground meat and shaping the patties, take care not to overwork the meat or the burgers will become dense. Sirloin steak tips are also sold as flap meat. Serve the burgers with your favorite toppings or one of our grilled-vegetable toppings (see related content).\n\n1. Place beef chunks and butter on large plate in single layer. Freeze until meat is very firm and starting to harden around edges but still pliable, about 35 minutes.\n\n2. Place one-quarter of meat and one-quarter of butter cubes in food processor and pulse until finely ground into pieces size of rice grains (about 1/32 inch), 15 to 20 pulses, stopping and redistributing meat around bowl as necessary to ensure beef is evenly ground. Transfer meat to baking sheet. Repeat grinding with remaining 3 batches of meat and butter. Spread mixture over sheet and inspect carefully, discarding any long strands of gristle or large chunks of hard meat, fat, or butter.\n\n3. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon pepper and 3/4 teaspoon salt over meat and gently toss with fork to combine. Divide meat into 4 balls. Toss each between hands until uniformly but lightly packed. Gently flatten into patties 3/4 inch thick and about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Using thumb, make 1-inch-wide by 1/4-inch-deep depression in center of each patty. Transfer patties to platter and freeze for 30 to 45 minutes.\n\n4A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Using skewer, poke 12 holes in bottom of disposable pan. Open bottom vent completely and place disposable pan in center of grill. Light large chimney starter filled two-thirds with charcoal briquettes (4 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into disposable pan. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\n4B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.\n\n5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Season 1 side of patties liberally with salt and pepper. Using spatula, flip patties and season other side. Grill patties (directly over coals if using charcoal), without moving them, until browned and meat easily releases from grill, 4 to 7 minutes. Flip burgers and continue to grill until browned on second side and meat registers 125 degrees for medium-rare or 130 degrees for medium, 4 to 7 minutes longer.\n\n6. Transfer burgers to plate and let rest for 5 minutes. While burgers rest, lightly toast buns on grill, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer burgers to buns and serve.\n\nAdd Salt for Juicier Burgers\n\nMixing ground meat with too much salt will make burgers tough, but 3/4 teaspoon helps the meat retain its juices.",

Stir in salt, cumin, baking powder and flour until well-mixed., but not really a dough.\n\n4) Stick it in the fridge, covered, for anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours. The longer the better. (I did it for an hour, and turned out nicely.)\n\n5) With your hands, make small falafel hockey pucks about 1 to 1-1/2 inches in diameter and ¾ of an inch high. (The flat surface will help with the frying.)\n\n6) Turn oven to 400ºF.\n\n7) Heat 2 Tbsp vegetable oil in a huge ovenproof skillet on medium-high. Fry the pucks for about 3 minutes on the first side, and 2 minutes on the second, until they’re golden brown.\n\n8) When finished, stick skillet in oven (or transfer pucks to a Pam-ed aluminum foil lined cookie sheet) and bake for 10-12 minutes.\n\n9) Stick four balls in half a pita with tomatoes, green pepper, and onions. Drizzle with tahini sauce (recipe below).\n\n",

    "name": "Cinnamon Cloudcakes Pancakes",
    "ingredients": "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n3 tablespoons sugar\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n3/4 teaspoon table salt\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1 1/4 cups low-fat buttermilk(see headnote)\n1/4 cup sour cream\n2 large eggs, separated, plus 2 extra egg whites\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled\n1 - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: One of our favorite pancake recipes is Cloudcakes. This recipe creates light-as-air pancakes with a tangy kick. Cloudcakes get their airy texture when the eggs are separated and the whites are beaten into a stiff foam. We used a rubber spatula to gently fold the whites into the other ingredients, and were careful not to deflate them. To create an even lighter texture in our Cloudcakes recipe, we added two egg whites to two whole eggs. We found that combining buttermilk with sour cream in this recipe created a great tangy flavor and gave the Cloudcakes an added lift. Adding cinnamon and sugar gave our Cloudcakes recipe a taste reminiscent of cinnamon toast.\n\n1. Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in large bowl. Stir buttermilk and sour cream together in medium bowl until combined. Add egg yolks and butter to buttermilk mixture, and stir well to combine. With electric mixer or balloon whisk, beat all 4 egg whites in large bowl to soft peaks. Pour buttermilk mixture over dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. (Batter should be lumpy, with visible streaks of flour.) Using spatula, carefully fold whites into batter until just combined. Do not overmix--a few streaks of whites should be visible.\n\n2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Using 1/8-cup measure or small ladle, spoon batter into pan. Cook until bottoms are evenly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Serve, cooking remaining batter and using more vegetable oil as needed to grease pan.",

Position vegetables cut sides down in single layer in center of sheet.\n\nPat chicken dry with paper towels. Leaving drumsticks and thighs attached, make 4 parallel diagonal slashes in chicken: 1 across drumsticks, 1 across leg joints, and 2 across thighs (each slash should reach bone). Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place 1 piece of chicken, skin side up, in each corner of sheet (chicken should rest directly on sheet, not on vegetables).\n\nWhisk garlic, lemon zest, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and remaining 1 tablespoon sage together in bowl. Brush skin side of chicken with seasoned oil mixture (use all of it). Transfer sheet to lower-middle oven rack and bake until cauliflower is browned, shallots are tender, and chicken registers at least 175 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nRemove sheet from oven and heat broiler. Scatter tomatoes over vegetables and place sheet on upper oven rack. Broil until chicken skin is browned and crisp and tomatoes have started to wilt, 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nTransfer sheet to wire rack and let rest for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.",
    "description": "Whole chicken legs (aka chicken leg quarters) are great to use for a cost-effective weeknight meal. For our goal of a one-pan meal, we decided to pair the chicken with cauliflower wedges and cherry tomatoes, all baked on one sheet pan. To help render the fat and season the chicken, we cut slashes through the meat and made a quick seasoned oil with olive oil, garlic, lemon, and sage to brush over the chicken. Positioning the cauliflower wedges in the center of the baking sheet, with the chicken on the perimeter, meant they would cook through in the same amount of time. To finish crisping the chicken skin and get some char on the cauliflower, we run the baking sheet under the broiler, along with the cherry tomatoes, for about 5 minutes.",

    "notes": "**made 2020-01-20** used bread flour; took about 4 hours to thaw from frozen.\n\nNew York-style pizza dough is an offshoot of Neapolitan-style dough—still a thin crust pie, but slightly thicker than its Italian cousin. The crust is sturdy, but not cracker-like, and instead features a tender chew thanks to the addition of oil in the dough. Using a food processor brings the dough together in 30 seconds flat, which is ready to bake the next day, so anyone can enjoy a city slice at home.\n\nWhy It Works\n    Oil coats individual granules of flour, creating a more tender finished product.\n    Sugar helps the crust to brown more evenly for a golden and flavorful crust.\n    The food processor develops the gluten faster than a stand mixer or by hand.\n    You can bake the dough the day after it's made, so no need for a long and slow ferment.\n\n",

    "directions": "1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Pat chops dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.

Whisk in vinegar, parsley, and remaining apple butter. Season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing sauce at table.\n\nMake Ahead: Chops and sauce can be refrigerated separately for up to 2 days. To serve, heat sauce and chops together over medium heat until chops are warmed through.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Tasters preferred 1-inch blade chops in our recipe for Cider-Braised Pork Chops for their heft, silky meat, and rich taste. It took a little longer for the chops to become tender, but the wait was worth it. Patting the chops dry before adding them to the heated Dutch oven helped them develop a flavorful crust. Apple cider lent a sweet tartness to the braising mixture and sauce, while a bit of fresh thyme provided a heady herbal component. Jarred apple butter added tons of flavor, and its natural pectin gave the sauce a thick, glossy consistency.",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nWe like the tang that buttermilk adds, but you can use regular milk; substitute 1/2 cup whole milk combined with 11/2 teaspoons lemon juice or distilled white vinegar. Avoid potato granules, which have a slightly metallic taste. We find that 85 percent lean ground beef is the best option here. Fattier options (such as 80 percent lean ground beef) can be a bit greasy. Leaner options will make fairly dry meatballs. Cooking times for gluten-free pasta vary from brand to brand. Make sure to taste the pasta often, as it can overcook quickly. **Make sure to buy potato flakes, not potato granules**, which have a slightly metallic taste.",

    "directions": "In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high, heat oil until shimmering. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring constantly to avoid browning, until tender and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add ground beef and cook, using a wooden spoon to break up meat into small pieces, until the beef starts to brown, about 5 minutes.\n\nAdd chile powder, salt, ground cumin, black pepper, smoked paprika, dried oregano, ketchup, and 1 cup (240 ml) water. Cook, using a wooden spoon to scrape and stir bottom of the skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until liquid slightly thickens, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, season to taste, and cover to keep warm; set aside.\n\nFor the Cheese Sauce: In a medium saucepan, toss grated cheddar with cornstarch to evenly coat. Add 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) evaporated milk, salt, black pepper, and smoked paprika. Cook on low heat, whisking constantly, until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\nDivide cooked rice equally among 4 plates. Top each with taco meat, followed by the cheese sauce, lettuce, and sliced tomato. Garnish with salsa and crushed tortilla chips.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "For the cheese, if you want to keep it classic, you can skip making the cheese sauce and use 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar instead. To serve, add 1/4 cup of cheddar on top of each serving of beef. The residual heat of the meat will slightly melt the cheese. To get the best melty texture, use freshly grated cheddar, preferably on the thicker grated side. Pregrated, store-bought cheddar has extra ingredients that prevent it from as easily melting compared to the freshly grated stuff.",

    "directions": "**For the Vinaigrette**: Whisk all ingredients in bowl until emulsified.\n\nFor the Salad: Cook pancetta in large Dutch oven over medium heat until browned and fat is rendered, 7 to 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to paper towel–lined plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot. Add fennel and walnuts to fat left in pot and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fennel is crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.\n\nAdd half of vinaigrette to pot, then add half of greens and toss for 1 minute to warm and wilt. Add remaining greens followed by remaining vinaigrette and continue to toss until greens are evenly coated and warmed through, about 2 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer greens to serving platter, top with apple, sprinkle with blue cheese and pancetta, and serve.\n\n",
    "description": "Why This Recipe Works\n\nUsing a preheated Dutch oven provided just the right amount of heat to wilt hearty bitter greens without actually cooking them. We started by sautéing vegetables in the pot and then pulled the pot off the heat to let it cool slightly. When we added the greens, the warm vegetables slightly softened the greens and helped the entire salad retain heat longer. Finally, carefully choosing mix-ins that delivered a wide range of flavors and textures made these salads truly satisfying entrées.",

    "name": "Classic Shepherd's Pie (with Beef And/Or Lamb)",
    "ingredients": "**For the Mashed Potatoes:**\n3 1/2 pounds (1.6kg) russet potatoes (about 4 large), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces\nKosher salt\n6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, cubed\n\n**For the Meat Sauce:**\n1 1/2 cups (360ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock\n2 packets unflavored gelatin (about 5 teaspoons; 1/2 ounce; 14g)\n2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil\n2 1/2 pounds (1kg) ground beef or lamb, or some combination (see notes)\n1 large yellow onion (about 14 ounces; 400g), diced\n3 medium carrots (about 8 ounces; 225g), diced\n2 ribs celery (about 4 ounces; 110g), diced\n2 medium cloves garlic, minced\n2 tablespoons (30ml) tomato paste\n1 cup (240ml) dry red wine\n2 sprigs thyme\n1 bay leaf\n1 tablespoon (15ml) Worcestershire sauce\n1 teaspoon (5ml) Marmite (optional)\n2 tablespoons (15g) all-purpose flour\n8 ounces (225g) frozen peas\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n**To Assemble:**\n1 1/2 cups (360ml) heavy cream\nGrated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for topping (optional)",
    "directions": "**For the Mashed Potatoes:**\nSet cubed potatoes in a colander and rinse under cold water until water runs clear. Transfer to a large saucepan and cover with cold water by at least 2 inches. Season water with salt until almost as salty as the sea. Bring water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until a knife easily pierces potatoes with no resistance, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes in colander, then rinse with hot running water for 30 seconds. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl.\n\nUsing a potato masher, food mill, or ricer, mash potatoes with butter. Press surface smooth, then press plastic wrap directly against surface to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside until ready to assemble.\n\n**Meanwhile, for the Meat Sauce:**\nPlace stock in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, sprinkle with gelatin, and set aside.\n\nHeat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add half of ground meat and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot, until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes; use a potato masher or large whisk to break up meat. Add remaining meat and cook, breaking up with masher or whisk, until reduced to small bits, about 3 minutes; lower heat as necessary to prevent scorching. If meat has rendered an excessive amount of fat, use a metal spoon to ladle most of it out, leaving just a few tablespoons in the pot. Add onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot, until just beginning to soften slightly, about 4 minutes.\n\nAdd tomato paste and cook over medium heat, stirring, for 1 minute. Add red wine and bring to a simmer over high heat. Cook, scraping up any browned bits, until almost fully evaporated. Add reserved chicken stock, thyme, bay leaf, Worcestershire, and Marmite, if using. Sprinkle flour over ground meat in pot, then stir in. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is reduced and thick, about 20 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Stir in peas and season with salt and pepper.\n\nTo Assemble and Bake: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Before assembling, heat cream in a large saucepan until simmering. Add potatoes and stir gently until completely incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Potatoes are now ready for assembly.\n\nSet a 9- by 13-inch baking dish on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Add meat sauce, being careful not to fill more than halfway. (You might not need all of the sauce, depending on the exact size of your baking dish.) Top with mashed potatoes, spreading them with a spatula to cover surface completely. Using spatula, create a dappled pattern on top of potatoes. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, if using.\n\nTransfer to oven and bake until top is browned and casserole is fully heated through, about 20 minutes. For deeper browning, place casserole on a rack set about 6 inches under a hot broiler for the last few moments of cooking. (Monitor closely to prevent potatoes from burning.)\n\nLet stand 15 to 20 minutes before serving. \n\n**Casserole can be assembled, wrapped with plastic, and refrigerated up to 2 days**. Reheat in a 350°F (180°C) oven for about 35 minutes, then use broiler to brown top.",

    "name": "Garlic-Lime Grilled Pork Tenderloin Steaks",
    "ingredients": "2 pounds pork tenderloins (2 loins), trimmed\n1 tablespoon grated lime zest, from 2 limes\n¼ cup lime juice, from 2 limes\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n4 teaspoons honey\n2 teaspoons fish sauce\n¾ teaspoon salt\n½ teaspoon pepper\n½ cup vegetable oil\n4 teaspoons mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro\nFlake sea salt (optional)",
    "directions": "Slice each tenderloin in half crosswise to create 4 steaks total. Pound each half to 3/4-inch thickness. Using sharp knife, cut 1/8-inch-deep slits spaced 1/2 inch apart in crosshatch pattern on both sides of steaks.\n\nWhisk lime zest and juice, garlic, honey, fish sauce, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle oil into lime mixture until smooth and slightly thickened. Transfer 1/2 cup lime mixture to small bowl and whisk in mayonnaise; set aside sauce. Add steaks to bowl with remaining marinade and toss thoroughly to coat; transfer steaks and marinade to large zipper-lock bag, press out as much air as possible, and seal bag. Let steaks sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.\n\nFOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\nFOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).\n\nClean and oil cooking grate. Remove steaks from marinade (do not pat dry) and place over hotter part of grill. Cook, uncovered, until well browned on first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip steaks and cook until well browned on second side, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer steaks to cooler part of grill, with wider end of each steak facing hotter part of grill. Cover and cook until meat registers 140 degrees, 3 to 8 minutes longer (remove steaks as they come to temperature). Transfer steaks to carving board and let rest for 5 minutes.\n\nWhile steaks rest, microwave reserved sauce until warm, 15 to 30 seconds; stir in cilantro. Slice steaks against grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drizzle with half of sauce; sprinkle with sea salt, if using; and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.",
    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\n\nThin pork medallions are tricky to cook well on the grill. We ditched the traditional shape in favor of pork tenderloin “steaks” by cutting tenderloins in half and pounding them to 3/4 inch thick. This simple step increased their surface area for a better ratio of browned exterior to tender interior. We also cut thin slashes in the steaks to promote better penetration of a garlic-citrus marinade that includes honey for better browning and fish sauce for meatiness. Finally we left excess marinade on the steaks to help keep their exteriors from drying out on the grill and then thickened some reserved marinade with mayonnaise for a bold finishing sauce.",

    "name": "Pommes De Terre Fondantes (Fondant Potatoes)",
    "ingredients": "1 1/2 cups homemade chicken or beef stock, or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth, plus extra as needed\n1/4 ounce (2 1/2 teaspoons; 1 packet; 7g) unflavored gelatin, such as Knox\n2 1/2 pounds (1.1kg) Yukon Gold potatoes, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long each, peeled\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil, beef fat, schmaltz, or duck fat (see note)\n4 tablespoons (55g) unsalted butter\n3 medium garlic cloves (15g), peeled and smashed\n1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped\nFlaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for finishing (optional)",
    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Place stock in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over top. Set aside.\n\nVicky Wasik\n\nUsing a sharp knife, cut off ends of potatoes to give them flat sides, then halve potatoes crosswise. Pat dry with paper towels.\n\nIn a 12-inch stainless steel straight-sided sauté pan or skillet, or cast iron skillet, heat oil or fat over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Season potatoes with salt and pepper and add to skillet, broad side down, in a single layer with space between each piece. Cook, without moving, until potatoes begin to brown around edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, rotating and swirling pan gently to promote even browning and prevent sticking, until potatoes are deeply browned on bottom side, 3 to 4 minutes longer, adjusting heat as needed if some of the pieces brown too quickly.\n\nUsing a thin metal spatula, flip potatoes onto second flat side. Add butter and cook, swirling constantly, until butter is melted and begins to foam, about 1 minute. Add garlic and thyme, and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add stock and bring to a boil.\n\nTransfer skillet to oven and roast until potatoes are completely tender, offering little to no resistance when poked with a paring knife, and liquid is reduced to a saucy consistency, 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nReturn skillet to stovetop. Using a thin metal spatula or tongs, transfer potatoes to a serving platter, broad side up, leaving sauce in the skillet; discard garlic. Bring sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook, swirling and stirring constantly, until sauce is emulsified, 30 seconds to 1 minute. If emulsion appears broken or sauce is too thick, add more stock or water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper and pour sauce over and around potatoes. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt (if using, otherwise season with a little more kosher salt), and serve.\n\nVicky Wasik\n\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately, but leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat with additional stock, up to 1/4 cup (60ml), to loosen and then re-emulsify the sauce.",

    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nTo create stovetop Brussels sprouts that were deeply browned on the cut sides while still bright green on the uncut sides and crisp-tender within, we started the sprouts in a cold skillet with plenty of oil and cooked them covered. This gently heated the sprouts and created a steamy environment that cooked them through without adding any extra moisture. We then removed the lid and continued to cook the sprouts cut sides down so they had time to develop a substantial, caramelized crust. Using enough oil to completely coat the skillet ensured that all the sprouts made full contact with the fat to brown evenly from edge to edge.",
    "notes": "**18-Jun-2019**: Try dropping temp to medium in step 1 because burned when on original med-high directions\n\nLook for Brussels sprouts that are similar in size, with small, tight heads that are no more than 1 1/2 inches in diameter, as they’re likely to be sweeter and more tender than larger sprouts. Parmesan cheese can be substituted for the Pecorino, if desired.",

    "name": "Thick-Cut Oven Fries",
    "ingredients": "3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, unpeeled\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\nSalt",
    "directions": "Choose potatoes that are 4 to 6 inches in length to ensure well-proportioned fries. Trimming thin slices from the ends of the potatoes in step 2 ensures that each fry has two flat surfaces for even browning. This recipe's success is dependent on a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet that will not warp in the heat of the oven. Spraying the sheet with vegetable oil spray will help the oil spread evenly and prevent sticking. The rate at which the potatoes brown is dependent on your baking sheet and oven. After removing the foil from the baking sheet in step 5, monitor the color of the potatoes carefully to prevent scorching.\n\nDESCRIPTION TEXT\n\n1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Generously spray rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Pour oil into prepared sheet and tilt sheet until surface is evenly coated with oil.\n\n2. Halve potatoes lengthwise and turn halves cut sides down on cutting board. Trim thin slice from both long sides of each potato half; discard trimmings. Slice potatoes lengthwise into ⅓- to ½-inch-thick planks.\n\n3. Combine ¾ cup water and cornstarch in large bowl, making sure no lumps of cornstarch remain on bottom of bowl. Microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, until mixture begins to thicken, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from microwave and continue to stir until mixture thickens to pudding-like consistency. (If necessary, add up to 2 tablespoons water to achieve correct consistency.)\n\n4. Transfer potatoes to bowl with cornstarch mixture and toss until each plank is evenly coated. Arrange planks on prepared sheet, leaving small gaps between planks. (Some cornstarch mixture will remain in bowl.) Cover sheet tightly with lightly greased aluminum foil and bake for 12 minutes.\n\n5. Remove foil from sheet and bake until bottom of each fry is golden brown, 10 to 18 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and, using thin metal spatula, carefully flip each fry. Return sheet to oven and continue to bake until second sides are golden brown, 10 to 18 minutes longer. Sprinkle fries with ½ teaspoon salt. Using spatula, carefully toss fries to distribute salt. Transfer fries to paper towel–lined plate and season with salt to taste. Serve.",

    "name": "Roasted Artichoke Dip with Spinach",
    "ingredients": "Topping:\n2 slices high-quality white sandwich bread, quartered\n2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted\n\nDip:\n1 (9-ounce) box frozen artichokes (do not thaw)\n1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry\n2 tablespoons olive oil\nSalt and ground black pepper\n1 medium onion, minced\n2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\n1 cup mayonnaise\n4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature\n1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (about 1/2 cup)\n2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon\n1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves\nPinch cayenne pepper",
    "directions": "1. FOR THE TOPPING: Pulse the bread in a food processor to coarse crumbs, about 6 pulses. Toss the bread crumbs with the Parmesan and butter; set aside.\n\n2. FOR THE DIP: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil. Toss the artichokes with 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and spread out over the prepared baking sheet. Roast the artichokes, stirring occasionally, until browned at the edges, about 25 minutes. Let the artichokes cool and then chop coarse.\n\n3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just shimmering. Add the onion and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and chopped spinach and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer the onion and spinach mixture to a large bowl and set aside.\n\n4. Stir the mayonnaise, cream cheese, Parmesan, lemon juice, thyme, and cayenne into the onion mixture until uniform, smearing any lumps of cream cheese against the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Gently fold in the chopped artichokes and season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the mixture to an ungreased 8-inch square baking dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly over the top.\n\n5. TO STORE: Cover the baking dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\n\n6. TO SERVE: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Unwrap the dip and bake, uncovered, until hot throughout and the bread crumbs are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Right off the bat, we knew we’d need to find a replacement for the tinny-tasting canned artichokes that most roasted artichoke dip recipes use. We liked frozen artichokes, which were passable if boiled, but far better if roasted with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Most artichoke dip recipes specify a 1-1 ratio of mayo to cheese; however, we found this made for a dip with a grainy texture. More mayonnaise remedied that, but the resulting batch lacked the creaminess we wanted. Adding sour cream made the dip’s flavor too tart, but a small amount of cream cheese produced a dip every bit as creamy as we wanted.",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "Freshly squeezed lime juice is highly recommended. Many bottled juices include a sweetener and that will make the dulce de tequila too sweet. Since a lime typically yields 1 ounce of juice, you should be fine squeezing half a lime directly into the shaker.\n\nSuperfine sugar has finer granules than regular white sugar and is often preferred for rimming because of its more delicate texture. There's no need to hunt it down at the store, though. With the help of a food processor, you can quickly make superfine sugar at home.\n\nThis recipe originally suggested only a lemon wedge as the garnish. That's unusual since lime is used in the recipe. If you want to get the most out of a single fruit, cut a lime in half, using one piece for the juice and the other to create a wedge for the garnish.",

    "directions": "For the chicken: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, sumac, allspice, black pepper, and cumin. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on prepared baking sheet and season all over with salt. Rub all over with spiced oil, pushing some under the skin. Roast chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 150°F (66°C) for the breast, about 25 minutes, or 175°F (80°C) for the legs, about 30 minutes. Let chicken rest 15 minutes, reserving any accumulated juices for the onions.\n\nMeanwhile, for the onions: In a medium Dutch oven or large skillet or sauté pan set over medium-low heat, stir together the olive oil, onions, and salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened completely and are turning golden around some edges, about 30 minutes; adjust heat as needed to either speed up or slow down the rate of cooking so that it's gentle but active.\n\nStir in the sumac, cumin, cinnamon, black pepper, and chicken broth, along with any reserved chicken juices, and cook, stirring often, until onions have cooked down to a jammy and glazed consistency, about 10 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and set aside.\n\nTo serve: Turn on broiler and position top rack about 4 to 6 inches from broiler element. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Working with one flatbread at a time, moisten the edges of each flatbread by dipping it into the oily glaze on the surface of the onion mixture and rotating it around. Set the flatbread on the prepared baking sheet.\n\nSpoon about a quarter of the onion mixture onto the flatbread and spread it around in an even layer, leaving a thin border around the edge (similar to pizza). Sprinkle all over with sumac and toasted pine nuts. Repeat with remaining flatbreads, onions, sumac, and pine nuts, stacking them one on top of the other (this keeps them moist, especially as you start to broil them).\n\nIf chicken has cooled too much, insert it under the broiler just long enough to rewarm and re-crisp the skin. Working with one or two flat breads at a time, arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and broil until the flatbread's edges have browned in spots, 1 to 4 minutes (keep a close eye on them as broiler strength can vary quite a bit). Transfer each flatbread to a plate, top with a whole piece of chicken, and serve.\n\nThe prepared onion mixture can be refrigerated for up to 3 days in an airtight container, then reheated just before assembly.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Taboon bread is best for this dish, but a sturdy flatbread, like homemade or store-bought pocketless pita or naan will do in a pinch.\n\nTo toast pine nuts: Toss nuts with 1 tablespoon olive oil, place on a microwave-safe plate, and microwave at 1 minute intervals, stirring in between, until golden brown and toasty, about 3 minutes total; alternatively, toast by tossing the nuts with 1 tablespoon olive oil and cooking over medium-low heat in a skillet, stirring constantly, until toasted, about 5 minutes total.",

    "ingredients": "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n2 tablespoons minced fresh chives\n1 garlic clove, minced to paste\nSalt and pepper\n2 (1-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed\n¼ cup hoisin sauce\n1 pound green beans, trimmed\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 ½ pounds fingerling potatoes, unpeeled, halved lengthwise\n\nSee:\n[recipe:Gluten Free Hoisin Sauce]",
    "directions": "1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Combine butter, chives, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl; set aside. Pat pork dry with paper towels and season with pepper. Brush tenderloins all over with hoisin sauce.\n\n2. Toss green beans, 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in large bowl. Arrange green bean mixture crosswise down center of rimmed baking sheet, leaving room on both sides for potatoes. Toss potatoes, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in now-empty bowl. Arrange potatoes, cut side down, on both sides of green beans.\n\n3. Lay tenderloins, side by side without touching, lengthwise on top of green beans. Roast until pork registers 140 degrees, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer tenderloins to carving board and dot each with 1 tablespoon reserved herb butter. Tent with aluminum foil and let rest while vegetables finish cooking.\n\n4. Gently stir vegetables on sheet to combine. Return sheet to oven and roast until vegetables are tender and golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven, add remaining 2 tablespoons herb butter to sheet, and toss vegetables to coat. Transfer vegetables to platter. Cut pork into 1/2-inch-thick slices and place over vegetables, pouring any accumulated juices over top. Serve.\n\nOne-Pan Pork Tenderloin with Green Beans and Potatoes\n\nPlacing the tenderloins directly over the green beans creates steam, which helps the beans cook through without drying out. The drippings from the meat also help flavor the green beans.",

    "notes": "Buy tenderloins that are of equal size and weight so they cook at the same rate. A rasp-style grater makes quick work of turning the garlic into a paste. Our favorite hoisin sauce is Kikkoman’s.",

    "ingredients": "5-6 pounds boneless pork butt, not trimmed, cut into 2-inch cubes\n1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced\n10 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled\n2 tablespoons ground cumin\n2 tablespoons ground coriander\n2 teaspoons dried oregano\n½ teaspoon dried thyme\n1 teaspoon red pepper flakes\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n1 cup vegetable oil\n\n**Additions from Serious Eats carnitas**\n1 whole orange, quartered\n2 bay leaves\n",
    "directions": "Heat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. In a large (at least 7-quart) Dutch oven, stir together the pork, onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, oregano, thyme, pepper flakes, orange quarters (squeezing juice in), bay leaves, and 2 teaspoons salt. Stir in the oil and 1 cup water. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook for 3 hours.\n\nRemove the pot from the oven. Stir the pork and return the pot, uncovered, to the oven. Cook until a skewer inserted into the meat meets no resistance, another 30 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a rimmed baking sheet in an even layer to cool. Tilt the pot to pool the cooking liquid to one side, then use a wide spoon to skim off as much fat as possible; reserve the fat. Bring the defatted cooking liquid to a simmer over medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about ⅓ cup, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\n\nWhen the meat is cool enough to handle, break the chunks into ¾- to 1-inch pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat. Add the pork back to the pot and stir until evenly moistened with the reduced cooking liquid.\n\nIn a nonstick 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 teaspoon of the reserved fat until barely smoking. Add the pork in an even layer and cook without stirring, pressing the meat against the skillet with a spatula, until the bottom begins to brown and the pork is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Tip: Don't trim the fat from the pork shoulder. The pork should render its fat in the oven and so the meat cooks slowly in it and the juices. And after cooking, don't discard the fat you skim off the cooking liquid—you'll need some of it to crisp the shredded pork in a hot skillet.\n\n\nMade 2024-12 - Excellent results. Maybe slightly overcooked, might try reducing first cook time by 15-20 minutes.\nTried on 13-May-2020. Results?",

    "directions": "FOR THE DOUGH: Adjust oven rack 4 to 5 inches from broiler element, set pizza stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees.\n\nWhile oven heats, process bread flour, semolina flour, yeast, and sugar in food processor until combined, about 2 seconds. With processor running, slowly pour warm water, lager, vinegar, and oil through feed tube; process until dough is just combined and no dry flour remains, about 10 seconds. Let dough stand for 10 minutes.\n\nAdd salt to dough and process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of workbowl, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and gently knead until smooth, about 15 seconds. Divide dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each into smooth ball.\n\nSpray 11-inch circle in center of large sheet of parchment paper with oil spray. Place 1 ball of dough in center of parchment. Spray top of dough with oil spray. Using rolling pin, roll dough into 10-inch circle. Cover with second sheet of parchment. Using rolling pin and your hands, continue to roll and press dough into 11½-inch circle. Set aside and repeat rolling with second ball of dough. Let dough stand at room temperature until slightly puffy, 30 minutes.\n\nFOR THE SAUCE: Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to medium bowl.\n\nFOR THE PIZZA: When dough has rested for 20 minutes, heat broiler for 10 minutes. Remove top piece of parchment from 1 disk of dough and dust top of dough lightly with all-purpose flour. Using your hands or pastry brush, spread flour evenly over dough, brushing off any excess. Liberally dust pizza peel with all-purpose flour. Flip dough onto peel, parchment side up. Carefully remove parchment and discard.\n\nUsing back of spoon or ladle, spread ½ cup sauce in thin layer over surface of dough, leaving ¾-inch border around edge. Sprinkle ¼ cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by ¾ cup mozzarella. Slide pizza carefully onto stone and return oven to 500 degrees. Bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 8 to 12 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through baking.\n\nTransfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to top and bake second pizza.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "For the best results, weigh your ingredients. We like the depth anchovies add to the sauce, but you can omit them, if desired. For the mild lager, we recommend Budweiser or Stella Artois. Extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to a month. Some baking stones can crack under the intense heat of the broiler. Our recommended stone from Old Stone Oven won't, but if you're using another stone, check the manufacturer's website. If you don't have a pizza peel, use an overturned rimmed baking sheet instead.",

    "name": "Thin-Crust Pizza",
    "ingredients": "**Dough**\n3 cups (16 1/2 ounces) bread flour, plus more for work surface (see note)\n2 tablespoons sugar\n½ teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast\n1 ⅓ cups (10 1/2 ounces) ice water \n1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for work surface\n1 ½ teaspoons table salt\n\n**Sauce**\n1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and liquid discarded\n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon red wine vinegar\n2 medium garlic cloves (about 2 teaspoons) minced\n1 teaspoon table salt\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n¼ teaspoon ground black pepper\n\n**Cheese**\n1 ounce finely grated Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup) 8 ounces whole milk mozzarella, shredded (about 2 cups) (see note)",
    "directions": "FOR THE DOUGH: In food processor fitted with metal blade, process flour, sugar, and yeast until combined, about 2 seconds. With machine running, slowly add water through feed tube; process until dough is just combined and no dry flour remains, about 10 seconds. Let dough stand 10 minutes.\n\nAdd oil and salt to dough and process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of workbowl, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove dough from bowl and knead briefly on lightly oiled countertop until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape dough into tight ball and place in large, lightly oiled bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 3 days.\n\nFOR THE SAUCE: Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to medium bowl or container and refrigerate until ready to use.\n\nTO BAKE THE PIZZA: One hour before baking pizza, adjust oven rack to second highest position (rack should be about 4 to 5 inches below broiler), set pizza stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and divide in half. Shape each half into smooth, tight ball. Place on lightly oiled baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart; cover loosely with plastic wrap coated with nonstick cooking spray; let stand for 1 hour.\n\nCoat 1 ball of dough generously with flour and place on well-floured countertop. Using fingertips, gently flatten into 8-inch disk, leaving 1 inch of outer edge slightly thicker than center. Using hands, gently stretch disk into 12-inch round, working along edges and giving disk quarter turns as you stretch. Transfer dough to well-floured peel and stretch into 13-inch round. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce in thin layer over surface of dough, leaving 1/4-inch border around edge. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 1 cup mozzarella. Slide pizza carefully onto stone and bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through. Remove pizza and place on wire rack for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat step 5 to shape, top, and bake second pizza.\n\nTOPPING TIPS: We like our Thin-Crust Pizza simply dressed with tomato sauce and handfuls of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan, but additional toppings are always an option--provided they're prepared correctly and added judiciously. (An overloaded pie will bake up soggy.) Here are a few guidelines for how to handle different types of toppings.\n\nHEARTY VEGETABLES Aim for a maximum of 6 ounces per pie, spread out in a single layer. Vegetables such as onions, peppers, and mushrooms should be thinly sliced and lightly sautéed (or microwaved for a minute or two along with a little olive oil) before using.\n\nDELICATE VEGETABLES AND HERBS Leafy greens and herbs like spinach and basil are best placed beneath the cheese to protect them or added raw to the fully cooked pizza.\n\nMEATS Proteins (no more than 4 ounces per pie) should be precooked and drained to remove excess fat. We like to poach meats like sausage (broken up into 1/2-inch chunks), pepperoni, or ground beef for 4 to 5 minutes in a wide skillet along with 1/4 cup of water, which helps to render the fat while keeping the meat moist.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Our preferred brand of whole-milk mozzarella is Sorrento Galbani. You can shape the second dough ball while the first pizza bakes, but don't top the pizza until right before you bake it. If you don't have a baking stone, bake the pizzas on an overturned and preheated rimmed baking sheet. It is important to use ice water in the dough to prevent overheating the dough while in the food processor. Semolina flour is ideal for dusting the peel; use it in place of bread flour if you have it. The sauce will yield more than needed in the recipe; extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to a month.",

    "name": "Argentinian-Style Stuffed Pork Loin with Chimichurri",
    "ingredients": "3 cups lightly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley\nLeaves from 1 bunch fresh oregano (⅓ to ½ cup)\n7 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled\n1½ teaspoons ground cumin\n1½ teaspoons ground coriander\n¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n¼ cup red wine vinegar\n¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon ground cumin\n1 tablespoon ground coriander\n2 teaspoons packed light brown sugar\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n4 pound boneless center-cut pork loin\n6 ounces thinly sliced capicola or mortadella\n½ cup pitted green olives, roughly chopped\n1½ cups drained roasted red peppers, patted dry and torn into large pieces\n⅓ cup panko breadcrumbs\n3 hard-cooked large eggs, peeled and halved crosswise\n1½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\nFlaky sea salt, to serve (optional)",
    "directions": "To prepare the chimichurri, in a food processor, combine the parsley, oregano, garlic, cumin, coriander, pepper flakes, ½ teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Process until finely chopped, 30 to 45 seconds. Scrape the bowl, add the vinegar and oil, then process until as smooth as possible, 45 to 60 seconds. Measure ¼ cup of the chimichurri into a small bowl and set aside; transfer the remainder to a serving bowl; cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.\n\nHeat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with extra-wide foil and a fit with a wire rack. To prepare the roast, in a small bowl, stir together the cumin, coriander, brown sugar, 1½ teaspoons each salt and pepper. Set aside.\n\nCut eight 24-inch lengths of kitchen twine. Place the roast fat side down on a cutting board, perpendicular to the counter's edge. With a sharp boning or carving knife, cut along the length of the roast, down its center, stopping about ½ inch from the bottom. Starting at the base of the cut and with the knife blade held as parallel as possible to the cutting board, slice along the length of the roast, unrolling the meat with your free hand as you go. Continue cutting and unrolling the meat until the half is a flat, fairly even surface ½ to ¾ inch thick. Rotate the roast 180° and repeat with the second side. If there are areas that are slightly too thick, use a meat mallet to pound those areas to the same thickness.\n\nSeason the pork on both sides with the spice mixture. Place the meat fat side down and with a short side nearest you. Spread the reserved ¼ cup chimichurri evenly on the meat. Shingle on the capicola slices, covering the entire surface, then sprinkle evenly with the olives. Lay the red peppers on top, tearing as needed to cover the entire surface. Sprinkle evenly with the panko. Place the egg halves cut sides down in a row about 3inches from the bottom edge. Lift the bottom edge over the eggs and continue rolling the meat into a tight cylinder. Position the cylinder seam side down and tie at even intervals with the twine, then snip off excess twine. If any bits of filling fall out, simply tuck them back in. Brush the roast on all sides with the oil.\n\nTransfer roast fat side up to the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the top is nicely browned and center of the roast reaches 135°F, 1½ to 2 hours. Let rest on the wire rack for 30 to 60 minutes. Remove the chimichurri from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving. Cut the roast into ½-inch-thick slices, removing the twine as you go. Arrange the slices on a platter, sprinkle with flaky salt (if using) and serve with chimichurri.",

    "name": "Julia Child’s Stuffed and Split Turkey",
    "ingredients": "1 (12- to 15-pound) turkey, neck and giblets removed and reserved for gravy\n1 ½ teaspoon fresh sage minced\n1 teaspoon salt\n½ teaspoon pepper\n1 lb. sliced salt pork, rinsed well\nSalt and pepper\nWooden skewers\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n\n",
    "directions": "1. With turkey breast side up, using boning or paring knife, cut through skin around leg quarter where it attaches to breast. Bend leg back to pop leg bone out of socket. Cut through joint to separate leg quarter. Repeat to remove second leg quarter. Working with 1 leg quarter at a time and with skin side down, use tip of knife to cut along sides of thighbone to expose bone, then slide knife under bone to free meat. Without severing skin, cut joint between thigh and leg and remove thighbone. Reserve thighbones for gravy.\n\n2. Rub interior of each thigh with ¾ teaspoon sage, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Truss each thigh closed using wooden skewers and kitchen twine. Place leg quarters on large plate, cover, and **refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours**.\n\n3. Using kitchen shears, cut through ribs following vertical line of fat where breast meets back, from tapered end of breast to wing joint. Using your hands, bend back away from breast to pop shoulder joint out of socket. Cut through joint between bones to separate back from breast. Reserve back for gravy. Trim excess fat from breast. Dissolve ¾ cup salt in 6 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge breast in brine, cover, and **refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours**.\n\n4. Preheat oven temperature to **425 degrees**. Remove breast from brine and pat dry with paper towels (leave leg quarters in refrigerator). Tuck wings behind back. Brush surface with 2 teaspoons oil. Place turkey breast skin side down in skillet and roast in oven for** 30 minutes.**\n\n5. Remove breast from oven and, using 2 wads of paper towels, flip breast and place over two-thirds of stuffing. Arrange leg quarters over remaining stuffing and brush with remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Lightly season breast and leg quarters with salt. Tuck any large sections of exposed stuffing under bird so most of stuffing is covered by turkey. Transfer pan to oven and cook for **30 minutes** .\n\n6. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Continue to roast until thickest part of breast registers 160 to 165 degrees and thickest part of thigh registers 175 to 180 degrees, 40 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes longer. Transfer breast and leg quarters to cutting board and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\n7. Before serving, remove skewers and twine from leg quarters and place on each side of breast. Carve and serve.",

    "notes": "2024-11 - Try brine of 3.75% salinity - 3.5 for 12 hours was too little - **Check temp after first 45 minutes**\n2014-11 - Try barding the turkey without stuffing beneath. Cook stuffing in separate pan and baste with the turkey juices throughout.\n\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: In her 1989 cookbook, The Way to Cook, Julia Child separated a raw turkey into legs and breast to ensure that both white and dark meat were roasted to perfection. Other benefits included a quicker cooking time and a small mound of rich sausage stuffing that tasted as though it had been roasted inside the bird. We loved this idea but saw a couple of opportunities for improvement. In our version, we brined the breast to keep it juicy and flavorful. Jump-starting the cooking of the breast at 425 degrees decreased the overall cooking time, which also helped the meat retain moisture. To make even more stuffing, we increased the amount of bread, and we swapped the sausage for the brighter flavor of dried cranberries.",

    "name": "Grilled Vegetable Salad",
    "ingredients": "**Vinaigrette**\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n1 garlic clove, minced\n¼ teaspoon salt\n⅛ teaspoon pepper\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, mint, chives, or parsley\n\n**Vegetables**\n2 red bell peppers\n1 eggplant, halved lengthwise\n1 zucchini (8 to 10 ounces), halved lengthwise\n1 red onion, cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds\n4 plum tomatoes, cored and halved lengthwise\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\nSalt and pepper",
    "directions": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nServe as a side dish to grilled meats and fish; with grilled pita as a salad course; or with hard-cooked eggs, olives, and premium canned tuna as a light lunch.\n\nFOR THE VINAIGRETTE: Whisk lemon juice, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in oil. Stir in basil and set aside.\n\nFOR THE VEGETABLES: Slice 1/4 inch off tops and bottoms of bell peppers and remove cores. Make slit down 1 side of each bell pepper, then press flat into 1 long strip, removing ribs and remaining seeds with knife as needed. Cut strips in half crosswise (you should have 4 bell pepper pieces).\n\nUsing sharp paring knife, cut ½-inch crosshatch pattern in flesh of eggplant and zucchini, being careful to cut down to but not through skin. Push toothpick horizontally through each onion round to keep rings intact while grilling. Brush tomatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, and onion all over with oil, then brush eggplant with remaining oil (it will absorb more oil than other vegetables). Season vegetables with salt and pepper.\n\nFOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\nFOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium-high.\n\nClean and oil cooking grate. Place vegetables on cooking grate, cut sides down, and cook until skins of bell peppers, eggplant, and tomatoes are well browned and interiors of eggplant and zucchini are tender, 10 to 16 minutes, flipping and moving vegetables as necessary to ensure even cooking and transferring vegetables to baking sheet as they finish cooking. Place bell peppers in bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let steam to loosen skins, about 5 minutes.\n\nWhen cool enough to handle, peel bell peppers and tomatoes, discarding skins. Using spoon, scoop eggplant flesh out of skin; discard skin. Chop all vegetables into 1-inch pieces, transfer to bowl with vinaigrette, and toss to coat. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

    "notes": "**Ten Simple Steps**\n[photo:1]\n1. MAKE VINAIGRETTE: Whisk lemon juice, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Slowly whisk in oil, then stir in basil.\nWHY? Adding mustard to the mixture and slowly whisking in the oil emulsifies the vinaigrette so that it won’t break.\n\n[photo:2]\n2. PREP BELL PEPPERS: Slice off tops and bottoms of bell peppers and remove cores. Make slit down 1 side of each bell pepper, then press flat into 1 strip, removing ribs and remaining seeds as needed. Halve strips crosswise.\nWHY? Long, flat strips are easy to handle on the grill.\n\n[photo:3]\n3. SCORE EGGPLANT AND ZUCCHINI: Using sharp paring knife, cut 1/2 inch crosshatch pattern in flesh of eggplant and zucchini, being careful not to cut through skin.\n\nWHY? Cutting through the flesh of these watery vegetables helps them release excess moisture during grilling.\n\n[photo:4]\n4. KEEP ONIONS INTACT: Push toothpick horizontally through each onion round.\n\nWHY? The toothpicks keep the onion rounds intact, making them easier to flip.\n\n[photo:5]\n5. OIL AND SEASON VEGETABLES: Brush vegetables with oil. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nWHY? A generous coating of oil ensures that the vegetables won’t stick to the cooking grate. Seasoning the vegetables well ensures a flavorful salad.\n\n6. PREPARE GRILL: Pour single layer of hot coals into charcoal grill or turn all burners of gas grill to high.\n\nWHY? A hot grill imparts flavorful char to vegetables quickly and ensures that they won’t stick to the cooking grate.\n\n[photo:6]\n7. GRILL CUT SIDE DOWN: Arrange vegetables on cooking grate with their cut sides facing down and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned and tender.\n\nWHY? Grilling cut side down browns the flesh first. Finish on the skin side, which can withstand longer exposure to heat.\n\n[photo:8]\n8. PEEL AWAY SKINS: When tomatoes and bell peppers are cool, remove charred skins.\n\nWHY? Blistering the skins makes removing them easier. Simply slip the grilled tomato skins off with your fingers. Use our steam method (see “Prepping Vegetables and Herbs” ) for the bell peppers.\n\n[photo:7]\n9. SCOOP EGGPLANT: Using spoon, scoop eggplant flesh out of skin.\n\nWHY? The eggplant flesh becomes tender during grilling, but the skin toughens. Discard the charred skin and use only the soft eggplant flesh.\n\n35313_stp-grilledvegetablesalad-cutandtoss-08\n10. CUT AND TOSS: Chop all vegetables into 1-inch pieces, transfer to bowl with vinaigrette, and toss to coat.\n\nWHY? Dressing the vegetables soon after they come off the grill causes them to absorb more vinaigrette.",

Using slotted spoon, remove wings from slow cooker and transfer to clean large bowl (discard liquid in slow cooker). Let wings cool 20 minutes (or cool briefly and refrigerate up to 24 hours).\n\n3. SAUCE AND BROIL Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat broiler. Set wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet and spray rack with baking spray. Whisk water, tomato paste, remaining sugar, remaining soy sauce, and remaining cayenne in bowl. Add half of sauce to bowl with cooled wings and toss gently to coat. Arrange wings, skin side up, on prepared rack. Broil until wings are lightly charred and crisp around edges, 10 to 15 minutes. Flip wings, brush with remaining sauce, and continue to broil until well caramelized, about 3 minutes. Serve.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: When we tried adding the sauce for our Slow-Cooker Sticky Wings to the slow cooker, the juices from the wings drowned it out. Instead, we cooked the wings bare. A sauce of soy sauce, tomato paste, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and cayenne won out over more complex options. For through-and-through flavor, we borrowed an idea from barbecue pit masters and coated the wings with a spicy paste before cooking. Achieving an acceptable level of stickiness wasn’t possible with a slow cooker alone. To give the wings their requisite “stick,\" we painted the cooked wings with sauce and set them under the broiler.",

    "directions": "Arrange the tacos so they face the same direction in the skillet to make them easy to fit and flip. To ensure crispy tacos, cook the tortillas until they are deeply browned. To garnish, open each taco like a book and load it with your preferred toppings; close it to eat.\n\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Combine water and baking soda in large bowl. Add beef and mix until thoroughly combined. Set aside.\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Add chili powder, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste and cook until paste is rust-colored, 1 to 2 minutes. Add beef mixture and cook, using wooden spoon to break meat into pieces no larger than ¼ inch, until beef is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer beef mixture to bowl; stir in cheddar until cheese has melted and mixture is homogeneous. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.\n\nThoroughly brush both sides of tortillas with 2 tablespoons oil. Arrange tortillas, overlapping, on rimmed baking sheet in 2 rows (6 tortillas each). Bake until tortillas are warm and pliable, about 5 minutes. Remove tortillas from oven and reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees.\n\nPlace 2 tablespoons filling on 1 side of 1 tortilla. Fold and press to close tortilla (edges will be open, but tortilla will remain folded). Repeat with remaining tortillas and remaining filling. (At this point, filled tortillas can be covered and refrigerated for up to 12 hours.)\n\nSet wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line rack with double layer of paper towels. Heat remaining ¼ cup oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Arrange 6 tacos in skillet with open sides facing away from you. Cook, adjusting heat so oil actively sizzles and bubbles appear around edges of tacos, until tacos are crispy and deeply browned on 1 side, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs and thin spatula, carefully flip tacos. Cook until deeply browned on second side, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary.\n\nRemove skillet from heat and transfer tacos to prepared wire rack. Blot tops of tacos with double layer of paper towels. Place sheet with fried tacos in oven to keep warm. Return skillet to medium-high heat and cook remaining tacos. Serve tacos immediately, passing extra cheddar, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, jalapeños, and hot sauce separately.",

    "directions": "FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE: Whisk all ingredients together in small bowl; set aside.\n\nFOR THE PANCAKES: Using wooden spoon, mix 1 1/2 cups flour and boiling water in bowl to form rough dough. When cool enough to handle, transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead until tacky (but not sticky) ball forms, about 4 minutes (dough will not be perfectly smooth). Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\nWhile dough is resting, stir together 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, sesame oil, and remaining 1 tablespoon flour. Set aside.\n\nPlace 10-inch cast-iron skillet over low heat to preheat. Divide dough in half. Cover 1 half of dough with plastic wrap and set aside. Roll remaining dough into 12-inch round on lightly floured counter. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil-flour mixture and use pastry brush to spread evenly over entire surface. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and half of scallions. Roll dough into cylinder. Coil cylinder into spiral, tuck end underneath, and flatten spiral with your palm. Cover with plastic and repeat with remaining dough, oil-flour mixture, salt, and scallions.\n\nRoll first spiral into 9-inch round. Cut 1/2-inch slit in center of pancake. Cover with plastic. Roll and cut slit in second pancake. Place 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in skillet and increase heat to medium-low. Place 1 pancake in skillet (oil should sizzle). Cover and cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until pancake is slightly puffy and golden brown on underside, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. (If underside is not browned after 1 minute, turn heat up slightly. If it is browning too quickly, turn heat down slightly.) Drizzle 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over pancake. Use pastry brush to distribute over entire surface. Carefully flip pancake. Cover and cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until second side is golden brown, 1 to 1½ minutes. Uncover skillet and continue to cook until bottom is deep golden brown and crispy, 30 to 60 seconds longer. Flip and cook until deep golden brown and crispy, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer to wire rack. Repeat with remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and remaining pancake. Cut each pancake into 8 wedges and serve, passing dipping sauce separately.\n\nTO MAKE AHEAD: Stack uncooked pancakes between layers of parchment paper, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours or freeze for up to 1 month. If frozen, thaw pancakes in single layer for 15 minutes before cooking.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nFor a vegetarian bean chili recipe that was rich and highly flavorful, with a nice, sharp heat as well as some gentle sweetness, we narrowed down a list of eight initial contenders to three beans with an earthy flavor and firm texture—red kidney, pinto, and black. To season our vegetarian bean chili recipe we decided to add a sweet red pepper to our base of onions and garlic. Chili powder, along with whole cumin seeds and a little cayenne, provided the depth and heat we sought. For the liquid, we decided to stick with water and the customary tomatoes.",

    "name": "Keto Quesadillas",
    "ingredients": "**Low-carb tortillas**\n2 eggs\n2 egg whites\n6 oz. cream cheese\n1½ teaspoons ground psyllium husk powder\n1 tablespoon coconut flour\n½ teaspoon salt\n\n**Filling**\n5 oz. shredded cheese\n1 oz. leafy greens\n1 tablespoon olive oil, for frying",
    "directions": "**Tortillas**\nPreheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).\n\nBeat the eggs and egg whites together until fluffy. (2-3 minutes with a mixer should do the trick.) Add the cream cheese and continue to beat until the batter is smooth.\n\nCombine the salt, psyllium husk powder, and coconut flour in a small bowl and mix well. Add this flour mixture one spoonful at a time into the batter while beating. When combined, let the batter sit for a few minutes. It should be thick like pancake batter. Your brand of psyllium husk powder affects this step — be patient… If it does not thicken enough, add more powder next time.\n\nPlace parchment paper on two baking sheets. Pour three circles on each sheet, for a total of six tortillas. Use a spatula to spread the batter into thin, ¼ inch thick rounds. Each tortilla should be about 5″ across.\n\nBake on the upper rack for about 5 minutes. The tortillas turn a little brown around the edges when done. Keep your eye on the oven—don’t let these tasty creations burn on the bottom!\n\n**Quesadillas**\nPlace three tortillas on a large cutting board. Spoon half the grated cheese on the tortillas.\n\nAdd a handful of leafy greens, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and top with another tortilla.\n\nHeat a small, non-stick skillet. Add oil (or butter) if desired. Fry each quesadilla for about a minute on each side. You’ll know it’s done when the cheese melts.\n\nCut quesadillas into wedges and serve.",

Cover and cook until paring knife meets no resistance when slipped into center of potatoes, about 12 minutes.\n\nDrain potatoes and return to saucepan.

We prefer a mixture of butterball potatoes and white sweet potatoes—it’s a nice combo of savory and a touch sweet. Then, we add bacon, eggs, and cheese, but it’s all optional. Feel free to build your breakfast sheet pan however you like. If you want to add in some peppers or mushrooms, we say go for it.\n\nPreheat your oven to 400°F. Add sliced potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil to your sheet pan and top it with a Seasoned Salt of your choice—Savory and Spicy work especially well. Roast potatoes 15–18 minutes until they are starting to brown on the bottom.\n\nRemove from the oven and flip potatoes. If you are adding bacon, now is the time. Add a few slices of bacon to cover the top of the potatoes, return to the oven and continue to roast until the bacon is mostly cooked, about 15 minutes.\n\nRemove from the oven again and make little wells in your potato stack. Crack the eggs into the wells and return the pan to the oven for 3 minutes.\n\nRemove from the oven and sprinkle with cheese and return for 1 minute, just until the cheese melts.

Set aside a large plate to transfer chicken to after breading.\n\nWorking with one chicken breast at a time, place chicken breast on a cutting board. Hold it in place with the palm of your non-cutting hand, and use a sharp knife to slice chicken horizontally into two even cutlets. Repeat process with remaining chicken breast. Cover each breast half with plastic wrap, and use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound to 1/3-inch thickness.\n\nPlace 2 chicken halves in prepared flour mixture, and turn to coat; tap off excess flour mixture, and transfer chicken to the large plate. Repeat process with remaining chicken halves.\n\nIn a large stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high until shimmering. Working in batches, add two chicken pieces to hot oil; cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes total. Repeat process with remaining 2 chicken pieces. Place browned chicken halves on prepared baking sheet, and place in warm oven (do not wipe out skillet).\n\nWhile chicken is resting in oven, heat the same skillet over medium-high. Add wine; cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet, until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 3 to 4 minutes. Add stock and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture has reduced to about 1/3 cup, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low.

    "description": "Balsamic fig pan sauce is like an Italian-style sweet and sour with a big hit of umami. Finely chopped dried figs are cooked with balsamic until the fruit is softened and the vinegar turns syrupy. It’s mounted with butter for silky richness, then spooned over Italian herb-seasoned pork chops. To complement the pork, there’s herbed ricotta mixed with crushed red pepper flakes for dipping, plus tender roasted broccoli and cabbage blanketed in melted Parmesan cheese. As a finishing touch, everything is sprinkled with toasted pine nuts for a buttery crunch.",

    "ingredients": "Kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon (4g) baking soda\n4 pounds (about 2kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size (see note)\n5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat\nSmall handful picked rosemary leaves, finely chopped\n3 medium cloves garlic, minced\nFreshly ground black pepper\nSmall handful fresh parsley leaves, minced",
    "directions": "1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F/230°C (or 400°F/200°C if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.\n\n2. Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.\n\n3. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.\n\n4. Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.\n\n5. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.",

You can also use a mix of the two.\n\nThe potatoes should be cut into very large chunks, at least 2 to 3 inches or so. For medium-sized Yukon Golds, this means cutting them in half crosswise, then splitting each half again to make quarters. For larger Yukon Golds or russets, you can cut the potatoes into chunky sixths or eighths.",

    "directions": "In a 4-quart saucepan, bring water and 1/4 cup salt to a boil over high heat. While water comes to a boil, trim roots from leeks, taking care to leave base intact. Halve leeks lengthwise, stopping 1-inch above the base. Rinse leeks thoroughly under cool running water to remove any dirt between layers. Using kitchen twine, tie both halves of each leek about two-thirds of the way up to hold them together. Line a plate with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel; set aside.\n\nLower leeks into boiling water; reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, covered, until base of leek can be easily pierced with a paring knife, about 12 minutes. Using tongs or a spider skimmer, transfer leeks to a paper towel-lined plate, allowing excess water to drip off. Let rest at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.\n\nWhile leeks cool, place sherry vinegar and shallots in a medium bowl and let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk in whole-grain mustard, Dijon mustard, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Slowly stream in olive oil, whisking vigorously and constantly, until emulsified and creamy. Set vinaigrette aside.\n\nRemove twine from leeks. Completely halve leeks lengthwise, and arrange, cut side down, on paper towel-lined plate. Place paper towels on top of leeks, and gently press down on leeks to remove any excess water.\n\nSpread half (40 ml) of the vinaigrette evenly over platter. Arrange leeks, cut side up, on platter; drizzle with remaining vinaigrette. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs, parsley, and capers.",

Add orange, lemon, and lime slices and maraschino cherries.\n\nServe immediately over ice, or refrigerate 8 hours to overnight for best flavor.\n\nFor a fizzy sangria, add club soda just before serving.",
    "description": "Any dry red wine will work, but we like to use fruity Spanish wine, such as Garnacha for the best flavor results. It doesn't have to be the most expensive bottle either. You'll be adding so many sweet ingredients to the wine that will dress it up.\n\nWe like to use what this recipe calls for (lemon, orange, lime, and maraschino cherries), but you can really use any in-season fruits that you like.",
    "notes": "You can use add ginger ale instead of club soda if preferred.\n\nMade 2022-06-24 -- did not have all the orange juice or the lemonade concentrate, but still very good.\n",

    "ingredients": "Tinga:\n2 pounds boneless pork butt , trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch pieces (see note)\n2 medium onions , 1 quartered and 1 chopped fine\n5 medium garlic cloves , 3 peeled and smashed and 2 minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\n4 sprigs fresh thyme\nTable salt\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon dried oregano\n1 (14.5-ounce) can tomato sauce\n1 tablespoon ground chipotle powder (see note)\n2 bay leaves\n\nTostadas:\n3/4 cup vegetable oil\n12 (6-inch) corn tortillas (see note)\nTable salt\n\nGarnishes:\nQueso fresco or feta cheese\nFresh cilantro leaves\nSour cream\nDiced avocado\nLime wedges",
    "directions": "1. FOR THE TINGA: Bring pork, quartered onion, smashed garlic cloves, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and 6 cups water to simmer in large saucepan over medium-high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and cook until pork is tender, 75 to 90 minutes. Drain pork, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Discard onion, garlic, and thyme. Return pork to saucepan and, using potato masher, mash until shredded into rough ½-inch pieces (see Step-by-Step below); set aside.\n\n2. Heat olive oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shredded pork, chopped onion, and oregano; cook, stirring often, until pork is well browned and crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\n\n3. Stir in tomato sauce, chipotle powder, reserved pork cooking liquid, and bay leaves; simmer until almost all liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaves and season with salt to taste.\n\n4. TO FRY TOSTADAS: Heat vegetable oil in 8-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat to 350 degrees. Using fork, poke center of each tortilla 3 or 4 times (to prevent puffing and allow for even cooking). Fry 1 at a time, holding metal potato masher in upright position on top of tortilla to keep it submerged (see photo below), until crisp and lightly browned, 45 to 60 seconds (no flipping is necessary). Drain on paper towel-lined plate and season with salt to taste. Repeat with remaining tortillas.\n\n5. TO SERVE: Spoon small amount of shredded pork onto center of each tostada and serve, passing garnishes separately.",

    "name": "Hoisin-glazed Grilled Chicken Legs with Napa Cabbage Slaw",
    "ingredients": "1/2 head Napa cabbage small, halved through the core end, tough core removed, and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch strips (about 4 cups) \n1 medium red bell pepper stemmed, seeded, and cut into thin strips \n4 tablespoons rice vinegar \n2 tablespoons soy sauce \n3 teaspoons fresh ginger minced \n1/4 cups vegetable oil \n1/3 cups hoisin sauce \n1 tablespoons Asian chile paste \n1/4 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder \n4 whole chicken legs trimmed of overhanging fat and skin \n",
    "directions": "Light a large chimney starter filled with charcoal and allow it to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a layer of fine gray ash. Build a two-level fire by stacking most of the coals on one side of the grill and arranging the remaining coals in a single layer on the other side of the grill. Set the cooking rack in place, cover the grill with the lid, and let the rack heat, about 5 minutes. Use a wire brush to scrape clean the cooking grate. The grill is ready when the temperature of the stacked coals is medium-hot and that of the remaining coals is medium-low.\n\nMeanwhile, toss the cabbage and bell pepper in a large bowl and set aside. For the dressing, whisk together 2 tablespoons vinegar, 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, and the oil in a medium bowl until smooth. For the hoisin glaze, mix the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, remaining 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger in a small bowl with the hoisin sauce, chili paste, and five-spice powder.\n\nCook the chicken, uncovered, over the hotter part of the grill until seared, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Move the chicken to the cooler part of the grill; continue to grill, uncovered, turning occasionally, until dark and fully cooked, 12 to 16 minutes. To test for doneness, either peek into the thickest part of the chicken with the tip of a small knife (you should see no redness near the bone) or check the internal temperature at the thickest part with an instant-read thermometer, which should register 165 degrees.\n\nDuring the last 2 minutes of cooking, brush the chicken with the hoisin glaze. Cook about 1 minute, turn the chicken over, brush it again, and cook 1 minute more. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Rewhisk the dressing and toss with the cabbage. Serve the chicken immediately, with the slaw passed separately at the table.\n\n",

    "ingredients": "\n\n",
    "directions": "FOR THE TOPPING: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Put the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Once the boiling reduces to a simmer, cook until the potatoes are tender and a fork inserted into the center meets little resistance, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nDrain the potatoes well and return them to the saucepan over low heat. Mash the potatoes thoroughly with a potato masher. Fold in the butter until melted, then stir in the warm milk and egg yolks. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover, and set aside while preparing the filling.\n\nFOR THE FILLING: Meanwhile, cook the lamb in a 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium heat, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink and the fat has rendered, about 3 minutes. Drain the lamb through a fine-mesh strainer, discarding all but 1 tablespoon of the rendered fat.\n\nHeat the 1 tablespoon reserved lamb fat in the skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion, carrots, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook until the vegetables are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the flour and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour is incorporated, about 1 minute.\n\nSlowly stir in the broth, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce, scrape up the browned bits, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nOff the heat, stir in the drained lamb and peas, season with salt and pepper to taste, and smooth the filling into an even layer. Dollop the potato topping evenly over the filling, then spread it into an even layer, covering the filling completely and anchoring the potatoes to the sides of the skillet. Bake the pie until the top is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the pie cool for 10 minutes before serving.\n\n",

    "name": "Greek-Style Lamb Pita Sandwiches with Tzatziki Sauce—Gyros",
    "ingredients": "**For Tzatziki Sauce:**\n1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt\n½ medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced fine (about 1/2 cup)\n⅜ teaspoon table salt\n1 tablespoon juice from 1 lemon\n1 small garlic clove, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1/2 teaspoon)\n1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint leaves or dill\n\n**For Lamb Patties**\n4 (8-inch) pita breads (see note above)\n½ medium onion, chopped coarse (about 3/4 cup)\n4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice\n½ teaspoon table salt\n¼ teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano leaves\n2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\n1 pound ground lamb\n2 teaspoons vegetable oil\n\n**Accompaniments**\n1 large tomato, sliced thin\n2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce\n2 ounces crumbled feta cheese (about 1/2 cup)",
    "directions": "**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**\n\nSince the yogurt and cucumbers in the Tzatziki Sauce need to drain for 30 minutes, start making the sauce before the patties. Although we prefer the richness of plain whole-milk yogurt, low-fat yogurt can be substituted. Greek yogurt can also be substituted, but use 1/2 cup and skip the step of draining. While we didn’t like the flavor of dried mint, dried dill may be used in place of fresh, but reduce the amount to 1/2 teaspoon. \n\nFor the patties, the test kitchen prefers the flavor of fresh oregano, but 1 teaspoon of dried can be substituted. The skillet may appear crowded when you begin cooking the patties, but they will shrink slightly as they cook. \n\nIf using pocketless pitas (see illustrations below for folding instructions), heat them in a single layer on a baking sheet in a 350-degree oven for 5 minutes. Do not cut top quarters off pocketless pitas; instead, use a portion of a fifth pita to create crumbs in step 1. \n\nWhen cooking the patties, use a splatter screen to keep the mess to a minimum. The patties can be prepared through step 1 and refrigerated for up to a day or frozen before cooking as directed in step 2 (frozen patties should be thawed in refrigerator prior to cooking). This recipe can be doubled.\n\n**For the Tzatziki Sauce:** Line fine-mesh strainer set over deep container or bowl with 3 paper coffee filters or triple layer of paper towels. Spoon yogurt into lined strainer, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, combine cucumber, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and lemon juice in colander set over bowl and let stand 30 minutes.\n\nDiscard drained liquid from yogurt. Combine thickened yogurt, drained cucumber, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, garlic, and mint in clean bowl.\n\n**For the Patties:** Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Cut top quarter off each pita bread. Tear quarters into 1-inch pieces. (_You should have 3/4 cup pita pieces._) Stack pitas and tightly wrap with aluminum foil. Process onion, lemon juice, salt, pepper, oregano, garlic, and pita bread pieces in food processor until smooth paste forms, about 30 seconds. Transfer onion mixture to large bowl; add lamb and gently mix with hands until thoroughly combined. Divide mixture into 12 equal pieces and roll into balls. Gently flatten balls into round disks, about 1/2 inch thick and 2 1/2 inches in diameter.\n\nPlace foil-wrapped pitas directly on oven rack and heat for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add patties and cook until well browned and crust forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip patties, reduce heat to medium, and cook until well browned and crust forms on second side, about 5 minutes longer. (See below for tips on flipping patties.) Transfer patties to paper towel-lined plate.\n\nUsing soupspoon, spread 1/4 cup Tzatziki Sauce inside each pita. Divide patties evenly among pitas; top each sandwich with tomato slices, 1/2 cup shredded lettuce, and 2 tablespoons feta. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\n\nFor a home-style lamb sandwich recipe that would give us the same flavors and textures as restaurant gyros, even if they didn't have the traditional appearance, we pan-fried ground lamb patties flavored with oregano, onion, and minced garlic. To make the patties juicier, we added a panade (a paste of fresh bread crumbs and milk), substituting pita crumbs for the traditional bread crumbs. For readers who can’t easily find ground lamb, we developed a ground beef version of our lamb sandwich recipe.",

    "directions": "Position two racks near the center of the oven and heat the oven to 425°F. Heat a 10- to 11-inch heavy, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Generously season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Pour 1 Tbs. of the oil into the hot skillet and swirl to coat. Arrange the chicken thighs skin side down in the pan and cook until the skin is golden brown, about 7 min. Turn the chicken over. If a lot of fat has accumulated, carefully spoon it off and discard.\n\nWhile the chicken browns, toss the beans, tomatoes, onion, olives, and garlic in a large bowl with the remaining 2 Tbs. oil. Season with 3/4 tsp. salt and several grinds of pepper and spread the vegetables on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\nPut the skillet of chicken and the baking sheet with the vegetables in the oven, with the chicken on the higher rack. Roast the chicken until a thermometer inserted in the center of a thigh registers 170°F, 18 to 20 min. Continue to roast the vegetables until very soft and beginning to brown, 8 to 12 min. more.\n\nMeanwhile, remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the chicken to a plate. Spoon off and discard as much fat as possible from the chicken juices, add the wine, set over high heat, and boil until reduced to about 1/4 cup sauce, 4 to 6 min.; it should be syrupy and concentrated in flavor. Swirl in the butter, if using.\n\nRemove the vegetables from the oven and toss them with the basil. Divide the vegetables among four plates. Arrange one or two chicken thighs on the vegetables and drizzle with the pan sauce. Serve immediately.",

    "ingredients": "4 teaspoons vegetable oil\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n1 tablespoon chili-garlic sauce\n1 teaspoon sugar\n½ teaspoon cornstarch\n8 small heads baby bok choy (1 1/2 to 2 ounces each), halved, washed thoroughly, and spun dry\n2 tablespoons water",
    "directions": "1. Combine 1 teaspoon oil and garlic in small bowl; set aside. Whisk soy sauce, chili-garlic sauce, sugar, and cornstarch together in second small bowl; set aside.\n\n2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add bok choy and water and immediately cover. Cook, covered, shaking pan occasionally, for 2 minutes. Remove lid, toss bok choy, and then push bok choy to sides of skillet. Add garlic mixture to center and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Stir garlic mixture into bok choy and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until all water has evaporated, stems are crisp-tender, and leaves are wilted, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add soy sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and coats bok choy, about 15 seconds. Transfer to platter and serve.",
    "description": "When preparing baby bok choy, two main issues arise: cleaning the notoriously dirty vegetables and getting the stalks to achieve a perfectly tender-crisp texture before the leaves get too limp. Unlike mature bok choy, which is often chopped into small pieces for cooking, part of the allure of baby bok choy is showcasing its diminutive size. In this recipe, we struck a balance by cutting the bok choy in half lengthwise; this provided access to the areas where most of the dirt and grit typically hide so we could thoroughly clean them, and it helped the vegetables cook more evenly than if they were left whole. An initial stint of steaming gave the stems the head start they needed to soften slightly before sautéing. A mixture of soy and chili-garlic sauces formed the base of a salty and mildly spicy sauce. ",
    "notes": "If using heads larger than 2 ounces each, quarter them instead of halving. We spin the bok choy dry after washing to avoid adding too much water to the pan.\n",

    "directions": "Add dried chiles to a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stock pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with intense, roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. Do not allow to smoke. Remove chiles to a 2 quart microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl, set aside. (Alternatively, place dried chiles on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until pliable and toasted-smelling, about 30 seconds total. Transfer to a 2-quart microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl.) Add half of chicken broth and chipotle chiles and their sauce, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on high power until gently simmering, about 5 minutes. Remove from microwave and set aside for 5 minutes. Transfer chiles and liquid to blender and blend, starting on the lowest possible setting and gradually increasing speed to high (make sure to hold the lid down with a clean kitchen towel or a potholder to prevent it from blowing out). Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.\n\nSeason beef cubes generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in the base of a Dutch oven over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add half of the beef cubes in a single layer and cook until deeply browned on a single side, about 3 minutes. Remove from pot, set aside with remaining unseared beef.\n\nReturn Dutch oven to medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently until translucent and softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic, and if using, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, and oregano, and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add all meat (seared and non-seared) and accumulated juices back to pan along with chile purée, stir to combine.\n\nBring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Cover, leaving lid just barely ajar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is completely tender, about 3 hours. (Check sauce levels occasionally; if sauce gets too thick, add 1/4 cup water or stock until desired consistency is reached). Once sauce has thickened to desired consistency, cover completely for the remainder of cook time. Alternatively, chili can be cooked in a 200° to 250°F (95° to 120°C) oven with the lid of the Dutch oven slightly ajar.\n\nStir in optional fish sauce, and vinegar. Season to taste with salt and hot sauce. For best results, allow chili to cool and store in the refrigerator at least overnight and up to 5 days. Reheat the next day to serve.\n\nServe, garnished with cilantro, chopped onions, scallions, grated cheese, avocado, and warm tortillas as desired.",

    "directions": "Thawed berries shed a lot of flavorful liquid that must be reduced to a syrup on the stovetop before baking. While the blueberries are baking, prepare the ingredients for the biscuit topping, but do not stir the wet into the dry ingredients until just before the berries come out of the oven. A standard or deep-dish 9-inch pie pan works well; an 8-inch-square baking dish can also be used. Vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream is the perfect accompaniment. To reheat leftovers, put the cobbler in a 350-degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until heated through.\n\nThaw frozen blueberries in colander set over bowl to catch juices. Transfer juices (you should have about 1 cup) to small saucepan; simmer over medium heat until syrupy and thick enough to coat back of spoon, about 10 minutes.\n\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees.\n\nFOR THE FILLING: Stir sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt together in large bowl. Add berries, with syrup, and mix gently with rubber spatula until evenly coated; add lemon zest and juice and mix to combine. Transfer berry mixture to 9-inch glass pie pan, place pie pan on rimmed baking sheet, and bake until filling is hot and bubbling around edges, about 30 minutes.\n\nFOR THE BISCUIT TOPPING: Whisk flour, cornmeal, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl to combine. Whisk melted butter, buttermilk, and vanilla in small bowl. Mix remaining 2 teaspoons sugar and cinnamon in second small bowl and set aside. One minute before berries come out of the oven, add wet ingredients to dry ingredients; stir with rubber spatula until just combined and no dry pockets remain.\n\nTO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE COBBLER: Remove berries from oven; increase oven temperature to 425 degrees. Pinch off 8 equal-sized pieces biscuit dough and place on hot berry filling, spacing them at least 1/2 inch apart (they should not touch). Sprinkle each mound of dough with cinnamon-sugar. Bake until filling is bubbling and biscuits are golden brown on top and cooked through, 20 to 22 minutes. Cool cobbler on wire rack 20 minutes and serve.",

    "directions": "Rinse chickpeas and place in a large bowl. Cover with cold water, adding enough to allow the chickpeas to at least triple in volume. Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight. The next day, drain, rinse, and carefully dry chickpeas in a salad spinner.\n\nCombine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until chickpeas are very finely minced, stopping the food processor to scrape down the sides as necessary. A handful of the mixture squeezed into a ball should be able to barely hold together. If not, process a little more.\n\nTransfer mixture to a bowl, cover, and place in refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow time for more starch to seep out of chickpeas. This will help the balls retain their shape better once formed. Using a tablespoon measure, scoop out heaping spoonfuls of the mixture into your hand. Gently shape each into a ball (you will not be able to roll the mixture like cookie dough; this is okay) and place them on a clean plate.\n\nWhen all the balls have been formed, fill a deep cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet or Dutch oven with 3/4 inch of oil. Heat over high heat until oil registers 375°F (190°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Carefully lower chickpea balls into oil one at a time, allowing a little space between each ball and cooking in batches if necessary. Adjust heat as necessary to maintain a temperature of between 350 and 375°F (175 and 190°C). Allow to cook undisturbed until well browned on bottom sides, then carefully flip balls with a fork until browned on second side, about 4 minutes total. Transfer cooked chickpea balls to a paper towel–lined plate and season with salt. Repeat with remaining chickpea balls.\n\nServe immediately with tahini and/or hummus on the side, or stuffed into pita bread with tahini, tomatoes, cucumber, pickles, and shredded cabbage.",

    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Pulse bread and melted butter in food processor until coarsely ground, about 12 pulses. Spread crumbs in even layer on rimmed baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool on wire rack. (Do not turn off oven.) Once crumbs have cooled slightly, break up any large clumps into fine crumbs.\n\nMeanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Stir in pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until pasta is al dente. Drain pasta and leave in colander.\n\nWhisk ½ cup milk and cornstarch together in small bowl. Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter to now-empty pot and return to medium heat until melted. Stir in garlic, mustard, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining 2 cups milk and chicken broth and bring to simmer. Whisk in cornstarch mixture, return to simmer, and continue cooking, whisking often, until large bubble form on surface and mixture is slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Off heat, gradually whisk in Colby and cheddar until completely melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nStir drained pasta into cheese sauce, breaking up any clumps, until well combined. Pour pasta mixture into 8-inch square baking dish (or other 2-quart casserole dish) and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Bake until golden brown and bubbling around edges, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.",
    "description": "Our favorite traditional baked mac and cheese relies on béchamel sauce for its base. This sauce, which calls for whisking milk into a butter-flour roux, ensures smooth, creamy results in the final dish. For equally creamy results without the flour, we relied on cornstarch (first mixed with milk to prevent clumping), which thickened our sauce to the perfect consistency. (We kept our sauce mixture loose so that it could withstand the heat of the oven without drying out.) For the cheese, we found that a mix of Colby cheese (for meltability) and cheddar cheese (for rich flavor) delivered an appealing casserole that baked up smooth and creamy. Adding a little dry mustard and cayenne helped to boost the cheesy flavor even more. Now, all we needed was the perfect bread-crumb topping. The simple fix was pulsing gluten-free bread and melted butter in the food processor and then toasting the coated crumbs in the oven. Once baked on top of our casserole, the crumbs provided the ideal crisp counterpoint to our tender pasta and creamy cheese sauce.",

    "ingredients": "8 large eggs\n4 scallions, sliced thin\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon minced fresh sage\nSalt and pepper\n2 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled (1/2 cup)\n3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thin\n2 garlic cloves, sliced thin\n3 cups water\n6 ounces angel hair pasta, broken in half",
    "directions": "INSTRUCTIONS SERVES 4 TO 6\n\nTo ensure the proper texture, it’s important to use angel hair pasta for this recipe. We like to serve the frittata warm or at room temperature, with a side salad.\n\n1. Whisk eggs, scallions, olive oil, sage, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in large bowl until egg is even yellow color. Stir in Gorgonzola and set aside.\n\n2. Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and 1/8 teaspoon salt, cover, and cook until mushrooms release liquid, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook until liquid evaporates and mushrooms turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Stir in garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat. Transfer mushrooms to bowl with egg mixture and wipe out skillet.\n\n3. Bring water, pasta, remaining 7 teaspoons vegetable oil, and 3/4 teaspoon salt to boil in now-empty skillet over high heat, stirring occasionally. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, water has evaporated, and pasta starts to sizzle in oil, 8 to 12 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook pasta, swirling pan and scraping under edge of pasta with rubber spatula frequently (do not stir), until bottom turns golden and starts to crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.\n\n4. Using spatula, push some pasta up sides of skillet so entire pan surface is covered with pasta. Pour egg mixture over pasta. Using tongs, lift up loose strands of pasta to allow egg to flow toward pan, being careful not to pull up crispy bottom crust. Cover skillet and continue to cook over medium heat until bottom crust turns golden brown and top of frittata is just set (egg below very top will still be raw), 5 to 8 minutes. Slide frittata onto large plate. Invert frittata onto second large plate and slide it browned side up back into skillet. Tuck edges of frittata into skillet with rubber spatula. Continue to cook second side of frittata until light brown, 2 to 4 minutes longer.\n\n5. Remove skillet from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Using your hand or pan lid, invert frittata onto cutting board. Cut into wedges and serve.\n\nPasta Frittata Made Without Leftovers\n\nThough it’s usually whipped up with last night’s noodles, pasta frittata can be just as simple using our from-scratch approach.\n\nUSE A SKILLET: Add water, broken angel hair, and oil to skillet—the only vessel you will need for this dish.\n\nCOOK OFF LIQUID: Once pasta is tender, keep cooking until water evaporates and pasta starts sizzling in oil.\n\nLET IT CRISP: After about 5 minutes, pasta will start to crisp (check progress by lifting up the edge).\n\nLIFT LOOSE STRANDS: Pour eggs over pasta, then gently pull up top strands to allow eggs to flow into center.\n\nSLIDE AND INVERT: To brown second side, slide frittata onto plate, invert onto second plate, and return to skillet.",

    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Cutting the carrots in our recipe into identically sized batons gave us evenly cooked results with the best browning. Precooking the carrots right on the baking sheet kept their moisture in and minimized withering. We buttered and seasoned the carrots, tightly covered the baking sheet with aluminum foil, and cooked them in a very hot oven. When the carrots were tender, we slid the uncovered baking sheet back into the oven and roasted them until the moisture had burned off and the roasted carrots took on nut-brown caramelized streaks. \n\n1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. In large bowl, combine carrots with butter, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Transfer carrots to foil or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and spread in single layer.\n\n2. Cover baking sheet tightly with foil and cook for 15 minutes. Remove foil and continue to cook, stirring twice, until carrots are well browned and tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to serving platter, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.",

Stir 2 cups stock into rice mixture; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until almost all liquid has been absorbed and rice is just al dente, 16 to 18 minutes, stirring twice during simmering.\n\nAdd ½ cup stock to risotto and stir gently and constantly until risotto becomes creamy, about 3 minutes. Stir in Parmesan and shrimp. Cover saucepan and let stand off heat for 5 minutes.\n\nGently stir chives, lemon zest and juice, and remaining 1 tablespoon butter into risotto. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, stir in additional stock to loosen texture of risotto. Serve, passing lemon wedges and extra Parmesan separately.",

(Makes about 3/4 cup of dressing.)\n\n2 Toast the peanuts. Although the roasted peanuts from the store may already be cooked, you'll get even better flavor with just a little toasting. Heat a small skillet on medium high heat and add the nuts to the pan. Do not ignore or the nuts can easily burn. Stir a little with a wooden spoon until the peanuts begin to get browned in spots and you can smell the toasting aromas. Remove peanuts from pan to a dish.\n\n3 In a large bowl, toss the sliced cabbage, grated carrots, and peanuts together, and any other optional ingredients you care to add (like a little chopped cilantro or green onions).

    "ingredients": "3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breast halves, trimmed of excess fat and skin\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n3 medium jalapeño chiles\n3 poblano chiles (medium), stemmed, seeded, and cut into large pieces\n3 Anaheim chile peppers (medium), stemmed, seeded, and cut into large pieces\n2 medium onions, cut into large pieces (2 cups)\n6 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)\n1 tablespoon ground cumin\n1 ½ teaspoons ground coriander\n2 (14.5-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed\n3 cups low-sodium chicken broth\n3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 2 to 3 limes)\n¼ cup minced fresh cilantro leaves\n4 scallions, white and light green parts sliced thin",
    "directions": "Adjust the heat in this dish by adding the minced ribs and seeds from the jalapeño as directed in step 6. If Anaheim chiles cannot be found, add an additional poblano and jalapeño to the chili. This dish can also be successfully made by substituting chicken thighs for the chicken breasts. If using thighs, increase the cooking time in step 4 to about 40 minutes. Serve chili with sour cream, tortilla chips, and lime wedges.\n\n1. Season chicken liberally with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook without moving until skin is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, turn chicken and lightly brown on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate; remove and discard skin.\n\n2. While chicken is browning, remove and discard ribs and seeds from 2 jalapeños; mince flesh. In food processor, process half of poblano chiles, Anaheim chiles, and onions until consistency of chunky salsa, ten to twelve 1-second pulses, scraping down sides of workbowl halfway through. Transfer mixture to medium bowl. Repeat with remaining poblano chiles, Anaheim chiles, and onions; combine with first batch (do not wash food processor blade or workbowl).\n\n3. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from Dutch oven (adding additional vegetable oil if necessary) and reduce heat to medium. Add minced jalapeños, chile-onion mixture, garlic, cumin, coriander, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, about 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat.\n\n4. Transfer 1 cup cooked vegetable mixture to now-empty food processor workbowl. Add 1 cup beans and 1 cup broth and process until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add vegetable-bean mixture, remaining 2 cups broth, and chicken breasts to Dutch oven and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until chicken registers 160 degrees (175 degrees if using thighs) on instant-read thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes (40 minutes if using thighs).\n\n5. Using tongs, transfer chicken to large plate. Stir in remaining beans and continue to simmer, uncovered, until beans are heated through and chili has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.\n\n6. Mince remaining jalapeño, reserving and mincing ribs and seeds (see note above), and set aside. When cool enough to handle, shred chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding bones. Stir shredded chicken, lime juice, cilantro, scallions, and remaining minced jalapeño (with seeds if desired) into chili and return to simmer. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper and serve.",

    "directions": "For the Fajita Marinade: Combine soy sauce, lime juice, oil, brown sugar, cumin, black pepper, chili powder, and garlic in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup (120ml) marinade to a separate vessel and set aside.\n\nFor the Chicken: Place chicken in a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and add remaining marinade. Seal bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Massage bag until meat is fully coated in marinade. Lay flat in refrigerator, turning every couple of hours, for at least 3 and up to 10 hours.\n\nFor the Fajitas: When ready to cook, preheat broiler and position over rack to highest position. If you have a baking steel or stone, set it on the top rack and allow to preheat. If using a baking steel/stone, set a rimmed baking sheet on it to preheat as well; otherwise leave baking sheet at room temperature.\n\nRemove chicken from marinade and blot dry with paper towels. Arrange chicken in an even layer on rimmed baking sheet. Broil, without flipping, until chicken is well browned on top side, about 5 minutes. Broiler strength and oven designs vary greatly, so cooking times will vary as well; keep a close watch. If your broiler heats unevenly, you may need to move the sheet tray around for more even browning. Flip chicken and broil until second side is also browned, about 4 minutes longer (chicken cooked with the help of a baking steel/stone will already have browned on the bottom, so you can flip it and continue cooking to ensure it's fully cooked through). \n\nRemove from oven and transfer chicken to a platter to rest.\n\nSwitch oven from broil mode to 450°F (230°C). Add red, yellow, and green bell peppers as well as onions to baking sheet. Pour reserved 1/2 cup of marinade all over and toss until evenly coated; using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits on the baking sheet. Arrange peppers and onion in an even layer that covers the baking sheet from edge to edge, then cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and browned in spots, about 25 minutes (if your oven heats from the top, you will want to cook the vegetables on a middle rack to avoid excessive scorching and burning). If you're using a baking steel/stone, you can cook the vegetables on it, but keep a closer eye since they run the risk of scorching on the bottom; if this begins to happen, move the sheet pan to another rack.\n\nSlice chicken into thin strips, then add back to sheet pan with any juices. Return to oven to warm through.\n\nServe immediately with hot tortillas, guacamole, pico de gallo, and other condiments, as desired.",

    "name": "Vietnamese Scallion Sauce",
    "ingredients": "½ cup chopped scallions (5 or 6 scallions; see note)\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n¼ cup peanut or other neutral oil\n1½ tablespoons fish sauce or soy sauce\n1½ tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger\n1 teaspoon white sugar\n",
    "directions": "01 In a medium heatproof bowl, combine the scallions, ¼ teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Using your fingers, gently rub the salt and pepper into the scallions until the scallions begin to wilt.\n\n02 In a small saucepan over medium-high, heat the oil until shimmering, then pour the hot oil over the scallions; the scallions will sizzle. Stir, then stir in the fish sauce, ginger and sugar. Cool to room temperature.\n\n03 Seared and Steamed Asparagus: In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil until barely smoking. Add 1½ pounds asparagus (trimmed and halved on the diagonal) and cook, stirring only a few times, until charred. Add 3 tablespoons water, then immediately cover. Reduce to low and cook, stirring just once or twice, until the asparagus is crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve with scallion oil spooned over.\n\n04 Pan-Seared Shrimp: In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil until barely smoking. Add 1½ pounds extra-large (21/25 per pound) shrimp (peeled and deveined) in an even layer and cook without stirring until well brown, about 3 minutes. Stir the shrimp, then remove the pan from the heat and stir constantly, allowing the skillet’s residual heat to finish the cooking, until the shrimp are opaque throughout, another 20 to 30 seconds. Serve over steamed white rice and topped with scallion oil.\n\n05 Pan-Seared Skirt Steak: In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil until barely smoking. Add 1 pound beef skirt steak (trimmed and cut into 3- to 4-inch sections) and cook, until well browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes total, flipping once about halfway through. Transfer to a plate and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut the steak against the grain into thin slices. Drizzle with scallion oil.",

Stir in remaining 4 Tbls of sugar, 3/4 c of warm water, and the egg, milk, and salt. Add 4 c of the flour and stir to form a dough until smooth and elastic either by hand on a floured work surface, in a food processor, or in a mixer fitted with a dough hook; add more flour, if the dough is too sticky to work with. It should take 6-8 minutes.\n\nUse 1 1/2 tsp of the oil to lightly oil a large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, brush the top with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of oil, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1.5 hours. Punch down the dough and pinch off 2\" pieces. Roll them between your palms into smooth balls. You should have 14 to 16 balls. Place the balls on a lightly floured baking sheet and cover with a lightly dampened clean kitchen towel. Let rise again until puffy, about 30 minutes.\n\nSetup grill for direct grill and preheat to high\n\nLightly flour the cutting board, then roll out a dough ball on it to form a disk about 5\" in diameter. Gently slap the disk from one hand to the other to stretch it into an elongated 7 - 8 inch circle. Stretch circle into traditional tear drop shape and place on hot grill.\n\nCook the naan until the bottom is crust and browned and the top is puffed and blistered, 2-4 minutes. Brush the naan with butter, turn it over and grill the other side until lightly browned. Brush each naan with butter as it comes off the grill.\n\n",

    "name": "Thai Stir-Fried Pork with Basil, Chilies and Garlic (Pad Kraprao)",
    "ingredients": "7 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled\n4 or 5 Fresno chilies, stemmed, seeded and roughly chopped\n1 tablespoon oyster sauce\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n1 tablespoon fish sauce\n1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar\n6 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil, divided\n4 large eggs\n1 pound ground pork\n2 cups (1 ounce) lightly packed fresh holy basil or 3 cups (1½ ounces) lightly packed Thai or Italian basil, torn\nSteamed jasmine rice, to serve",
    "directions": "01 In a food processor, combine the garlic and chilies. Pulse until finely chopped, with some slightly larger pieces remaining, 8 to 10 pulses. In a small bowl, whisk together the oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar and ½ cup water. Set both the garlic-chili mixture and the sauce mixture near the stove.\n\n02 In a 12- to 14-inch wok over medium-high, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil until barely smoking. Reduce to medium, then crack 2 eggs into the center of the wok, each in a different spot. Use a silicone spatula to gently push the edges of the egg whites toward the yolks to try to keep the eggs separate (it’s fine if the whites touch in spots). Cook, occasionally spooning some of the hot oil over them, until the whites are fully set and the edges are crisp and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula, transfer the eggs to a paper towel-lined plate. Using 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil, cook the remaining eggs the same way; set the eggs aside. Wipe out the wok.\n\n03 Return the wok to medium-high and heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until barely smoking. Add the garlic-chili mixture and cook, stirring, until fragrant and lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the pork and cook, stirring, until the meat is broken up into mostly small bits, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sauce mixture and cook, stirring, until the pork is no longer pink and the liquid thickens slightly but remains saucy, about 3 minutes. Off heat, add the basil and stir until just wilted.\n\n04 Divide the rice and the stir-fry among serving plates and top each portion with an egg.\n\n05 SKILLET INSTRUCTIONS: Follow the recipe to process the garlic and chilies and combine the sauce mixture. In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil until barely smoking. One at a time, crack the eggs into the skillet, each in a different spot, then use a silicone spatula to gently push the edges of the egg whites toward the yolks to try to keep the eggs separate (it’s fine if the whites touch in spots). Cook, occasionally spooning some of the hot oil over, until the whites are fully set and the edges are crisp and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula, transfer the eggs to a paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Wipe out the skillet, return it to medium-high and heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering. Add the garlic-chili mixture and cook, stirring, until fragrant and lightly browned, 45 to 60 seconds. Add the pork and cook, stirring, until broken up into mostly small bits, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sauce mixture and cook, stirring, until the pork is no longer pink and the liquid thickens slightly but remains saucy, about 3 minutes. Off heat, add the basil and stir until just wilted.

    "ingredients": "¼ cup white sugar\n4 tablespoons coconut water or water, divided\n3 tablespoons fish sauce\n2 Fresno or serrano chilies, stemmed and sliced into thin rings\n1 stalk lemon grass, trimmed to the lower 5 or 6 inches, bruised\n2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh ginger\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into 1½-inch pieces\n1 tablespoon lime juice\n2 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal\n",
    "directions": "In a 12-inch skillet, combine the sugar and 2 tablespoons of the coconut water. Cook over medium-high, occasionally swirling the pan to help the sugar dissolve and to encourage even browning, until the caramel is mahogany in color and smokes lightly, 4 to 6 minutes.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and add the fish sauce along with the remaining 2 tablespoons coconut water; the mixture will bubble vigorously and the caramel will harden in spots. Bring to a simmer over medium and cook, stirring, until the hardened bits have dissolved. Add the chilies, lemon grass, ginger and pepper, then cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Increase to medium-high and stir in the chicken. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reduces and clings to the chicken, 10 to 14 minutes.\n\nRemove from the heat, then discard the lemongrass. Stir in the lime juice. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with the scallions.",

    "ingredients": "3 pounds russet potatoes Yukon Gold potatoes, or white potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick \n5 tablespoons unsalted butter melted \n1/4 cups vegetable oil  or peanut oil, plus additional for greasing cookie sheet \n",
    "directions": "1. Toss potato slices with melted butter in large bowl until potatoes are evenly coated. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. \n\n2. Pour oil into 10-inch heavy-bottomed ovenproof nonstick skillet; swirl to coat pan bottom and set skillet over medium-low heat. Begin timing, and arrange potato slices in skillet, starting in center (see illustrations 1 and 2 below) to form first layer. Sprinkle evenly with scant 1/4 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper to taste. Arrange second layer of potatoes, working in opposite direction of first layer (see illustration 3); sprinkle evenly with scant 1/4 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper. Repeat, layering potatoes in opposite directions and sprinkling with salt and pepper, until no slices remain (broken or uneven slices can be pieced together to form a single slice; potatoes will mound in center of skillet); continue to cook over medium-low heat until 30 minutes elapse from the time you began arranging potatoes in skillet. \n\n3. Using bottom of 9-inch cake pan, press potatoes down firmly to compact. Cover skillet and place in oven. Bake until potatoes begin to soften, about 15 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until potatoes are tender when paring knife is inserted in center and edge of potatoes near skillet is browned, about 10 minutes longer. Meanwhile, line rimless cookie sheet or back of baking sheet with foil and coat very lightly with oil. Drain off excess fat from potatoes by pressing potatoes into skillet with bottom of cake pan while tilting skillet to pour off fat (see illustration 4). \n\n4. Set foil-lined cookie sheet on top of skillet. With hands protected by oven mitts or pot-holders, hold cookie sheet in place with one hand and carefully invert skillet and cookie sheet together (see illustration 5). Remove skillet. Carefully slide potatoes onto platter (see illustration 6); cut into wedges and serve immediately.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "Do not slice the potatoes until you are ready to start assembling. Remember to start timing when you begin arranging the potatoes in the skilletno matter how quickly you arrange them, they will need 30 minutes on the stovetop to brown properly.",

    "name": "Roasted Mushroom Pizza with Fontina and Scallions",
    "ingredients": "1 pound portobello mushroom caps\n1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil\nTable salt and ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n1 portion pizza dough (warmed to 75°F)\nBread flour, for dusting countertop\n1 tablespoon semolina flour, for dusting pizza peel\n1 cup Fontina-Parmesan cream [recipe:Fontina and Parmesean Cream For Pizza]\n2 scallions, thinly sliced on bias\n1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes",
    "directions": "At least 1 hour before baking, heat the oven to 550°F with a baking steel or stone on the upper-middle rack and a second rack in the lower-middle.\n\nUsing a spoon, scrape off and discard the gills on the undersides of the mushroom caps. Halve any caps that are 5 inches or larger in diameter, then cut the caps into ¼-inch slices. In a large bowl, toss the mushrooms, olive oil and ¼ teaspoon salt.\n\nSpread the mushrooms in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast on the lower oven rack, stirring once, until they have released their moisture, the moisture evaporates and the mushrooms begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in the thyme and garlic, then roast until the mushrooms have browned and the garlic is no longer raw, another 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack. Leave the oven on.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a counter dusted generously with bread flour. Flour your hands and, using your fingers, press the dough, starting at the center and working out to the edges, into a 12-inch round, turning the dough over once. The round should be thin in the center, with slightly thicker edges. Lightly dust a baking peel, inverted baking sheet or rimless cookie sheet with the semolina. Transfer the dough to the peel and, if needed, reshape into a 12-inch round.\n\nUsing the back of a spoon, spread the fontina-Parmesan cream evenly on the dough, leaving ½-inch border at the edge. Scatter the mushrooms over it and season with pepper. Slide the pizza onto the baking steel or stone and bake until the crust is well browned, 7 to 9 minutes.\n\nUsing the peel, transfer the pizza to a wire rack. Let cool for a couple of minutes, then sprinkle with scallions and red pepper flakes.",

    "directions": "Warm the black bean and sweet potato mixtures in separate saucepans. Wrap tortillas in foil and warm in a 300 degree F oven, or heat each tortilla on both sides quickly in a heavy skillet over medium heat. In each tortilla place about 1/2 cup black beans and 1/2 cup sweet potatoes. Fold one side of the tortilla over the filling and then fold in both sides, and roll up into a burrito. Place on a plate and top with generous spoonfuls of salsa, guacamole and sour cream.\n\nVariation: You may fold grilled chicken, steak, or any other grilled meat into the burrito as well.\n\nBlack Beans -----------------\nIn a heavy saucepan, combine beans, onions, garlic, olive oil and water. Bring to a boil and simmer approximately 1 1/2 hours. Add the tomatoes and wine and season with salt and pepper. Simmer another 30 minutes or until beans are very tender. Using a wooden spoon or potato masher, mash the beans slightly. Leave some beans whole. This mixture should mound softly and be moist but not watery. Adjust by cooking longer or by adding water.\n\nFlying Burrito Mashed Sweet Potatoes ---------------------\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F.\n\nWash the sweet potatoes but leave the skins on. Rub with olive oil and bake until very tender, about 45 minutes. Cool the potatoes until they can be handled and remove skins. Place in a heavy saucepan and add the remaining ingredients. Mash the mixture well, taste for seasoning, reheat, and serve.\n\nThis mixture makes an excellent side dish as well as a burrito filling. It can be prepared while the black beans simmer.\n\nYield: 5 cups",

    "description": "Savory pork meatballs and jasmine rice give this Thai soup heft, but its aromatic broth—made with plenty of shallots, garlic, lemon grass and ginger—has excellent flavor on its own. The soup is a sort of blank canvas for garnishes; the recipe calls for our favorites, but feel free to offer only those that appeal to you. The fried shallots, however, are a must.",

Whisk vinegar, garlic, mayonnaise, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in nonreactive bowl until mixture appears milky and no lumps remain. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in oil. (Dressing should appear homogeneous, glossy, and slightly thickened, without pools of oil on surface.)\n\n3. Gently toss avocados, 2 tablespoons dressing, and ½ teaspoon salt in bowl. Transfer avocados to large platter or individual plates.\n\n4. Toss shallot, tomatoes, radishes, and basil with remaining dressing. Spoon tomato mixture over avocados and sprinkle with ricotta salata. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nButtery avocados demand an acidic dressing to cut their richness. We were able to emulsify a highly acidic vinaigrette with a bit of mayonnaise to ensure cling. To add textural contrast, we steered clear of leafy greens and relied on crunchier vegetables and juicy fruits. Arranging the dressed avocado chunks below the other ingredients maximized visual appeal by preventing the avocado from turning the salad murky.\n",

    "directions": "1. FOR THE SPINACH SAUCE: Place spinach in large microwave-safe bowl, cover, and microwave until wilted, about 3 minutes. When cool enough to handle, chop enough spinach to measure 1/3 cup and set aside. Transfer remaining spinach to blender and wipe out bowl. Place mustard greens in now-empty bowl, cover, and microwave until wilted, about 4 minutes. When cool enough to handle, chop enough mustard greens to measure 1/3 cup and transfer to bowl with chopped spinach. Transfer remaining mustard greens to blender.\n\n2. Meanwhile, melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds, coriander, paprika, cardamom, and cinnamon and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add onion and ¾ teaspoon salt; cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, and jalapeño; cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned and just beginning to stick to pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook mixture until pan is dry and tomatoes are beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.\n\n3. Transfer half of onion mixture to blender with greens. Add half of cashews and water; process until smooth, about 1 minute. Return puree to skillet.\n\n4. Return skillet to medium-high heat, stir in chopped greens and buttermilk, and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until flavors have blended, 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Gently fold in cheese cubes and cook until just heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to serving dish, sprinkle with remaining cashews and cilantro, and serve.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Paneer, the fresh cheese called for in this Indian recipe, is available in some specialty markets, but it couldn't be more simple to make a home with whole milk and buttermilk. For a spinach sauce with great flavor, we combine spinach and mustard greens and spice them up with onion, garlic, ginger and jalapeño, plus some chopped tomatoes. Pureeing some cashews into the sauce adds richness and body.",

    "directions": "Preheat the grill over medium-high direct heat. Oil the grill grates. Finely chop the cilantro and scallion and mix in the oil and ginger. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nCut two 3-inch long slits through the skin lengthwise on the bottom of the salmon fillets, going about halfway into the salmon. Evenly stuff the slits with the herb mixture. Season the fish with salt and pepper.\n\nStir together the lime juice, soy and honey until smooth. Place the salmon, skin side up, on the grill and cook until well marked, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the salmon and continue to cook, brushing the tops with the sauce, until the fish is cooked through, about another 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate and sprinkle the tops with the sesame seeds. Serve with edamame and lime wedges.\n\nBroiler directions: Position an oven rack so that a baking sheet set on the rack is about 4-inches below the heat source. Preheat the broiler. Prepare the salmon as above and place the fillets, skin down, on a foil lined baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Broil, basting 3 to 4 times with the sauce, until just cooked through, about 6 to 7 minutes.\n",

    "directions": "Heat a smoker to 290°F. Or set up covered charcoal or wood grill with indirect heat and wood chips.\n\nRemove and discard the sheer white membrane from the underside of the ribs. The layer will be slippery, so grab it with a kitchen towel to pull it off. Pat the ribs dry, then generously season both sides with salt and coarsely ground black pepper, patting the seasoning into the meat. Slide the ribs onto a wire rack and put in the smoker or on the grill away from the heat. You can also lay the slabs on the smoker or grill rack away from the heat. Smoke the ribs until tender or about 3 ½ hours. Continue to maintain a consistent temperature of 290ºF.\n\nWhile the ribs are smoking, whisk the honey and beer in a small bowl until blended. After about 1 hour of cooking the ribs, when juices start to bead up on the surface, **brush the ribs with the honey mixture and rotate the slabs for an even cooking.** After the second hour of cooking, flip the ribs over and baste with the honey mixture again. **Continue turning and basting every 30 minutes** until the meat is tender, takes on a reddish tint and starts to pull away from the bones.\n\nRemove the ribs from the smoker or grill and let them rest at room temperature until warm, at least 20 minutes.\n\nAdd wood or charcoal to the fire to bring the temperature up to medium; you will finish the ribs over direct medium heat.\n\nTo make the chile-lime butter use a blender to create a pureed mix with the garlic, lime zest and juice, scallions, cilantro, Chile paste, melted butter, and one teaspoon salt. Blend for at least two minutes.\n\nCut and separate the ribs into single-bone pieces and toss the pieces in the chile-lime butter puree.\n\nGrill the ribs again over the hot side of the grill just until they start to char, about 4 minutes per side.\n\nToss the ribs in the chile-lime butter and serve hot.",

    "directions": "Sous Vide Temperature 150°F/65.5°C\n\nSous Vide Time 1½ to 3 hours\n\nActive Cooking Time 50 minutes, plus marinating time\n\n1. Process arbols, shallot, oil, salt, tomato paste, sugar, paprika, five-spice powder, garlic powder, lemon zest and juice, pepper, cayenne, and bay leaves in blender until smooth, scraping down sides of blender jar as needed, about 1 minute. Place chicken and chile paste in 1-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag and toss to coat. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate chicken for at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.\n\n2. Using sous vide circulator, bring water to 150°F/65.5°C in 7-quart container. Gently lower bag into prepared water bath until chicken is fully submerged, and then clip top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook chicken for at least 1½ hours or up to 3 hours.\n\n3. Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and spray with vegetable oil spray. Transfer chicken skin side up to prepared rack and let rest while preparing sauce.\n\n4. Pour accumulated juices into 8-inch skillet, bring to simmer over medium heat, and cook until reduced by two-thirds, 3 to 5 minutes. Brush chicken with sauce and broil until skin is crisp and lightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.\n\nTO MAKE AHEAD: Chicken and accumulated juices can be rapidly chilled in ice bath and then refrigerated in zipper-lock bag after step 2 for up to 5 days. To reheat, return sealed bag to water bath set to 150°F/65.5 °C for 20 minutes. Proceed with step 3.",
    "description": "\n",
    "notes": "Why This Recipe Works\n\nFor our rendition of peri peri chicken, we start by blending garlic powder, tomato paste, herbs, spices, lemon juice, and dried arbol chiles to make a thick paste. We throw the paste straight into a plastic bag with the chicken to first marinate and then circulate. (Marinating is key to give the salt time to penetrate the meat to both season it and help it retain moisture during cooking.) Because there is little to no evaporation due to the sealed bag, this cooking method produces a considerable amount of juices. We reduce the juices in a pan to intensify the flavors, and then we brush them over the chicken before giving the meat a final broil in the oven to brown the skin.",

    "directions": "Combine the marinade ingredients\n\nDry chicken well before putting in marinade. Place them into the bowl of marinade. Coat each piece thoroughly, then set aside for about 30 minutes. For maximum penetration of the flavor into the chicken, keep the meat-side down facing the marinade (as opposed to the skin side which wouldn't absorb the marinade. \n\nWhen they’ve finished marinating, spread an even layer of cornstarch (3 tbsp) on a plate, and coat each side of the thighs with a thin layer of cornstarch. Gently shake off excess cornstarch.\n\nHeat a skillet or flat-bottomed wok on high heat. Once it’s hot, add oil (2 tbsp).\nWhen the oil’s shimmering, turn the heat to medium-low, and place each piece of the chicken skin-side down. Cook until golden brown, or about 2-3 minutes.\n\nFlip the chicken over and cook the other side until it’s also golden brown, or about 5-6 minutes.\nWhen both sides are beautifully golden brown, flip all the pieces back to the skin side and cook for another 1-2 minutes to make it crispy.\n\nSeason chicken with garlic powder and a little salt, remove from pan.\nAdd 1 tsp oil. Add the minced garlic to the now-vacated middle of the pan, and cook until fragrant, or 10 seconds. Add the sliced onion and spread it out in the pan as you cook until that’s also fragrant, or 20 seconds.\n\nPour cooking wine (1 tbsp) into the pan and immediately cover with the lid. Turn the heat to high to reduce the sauce down. Cook covered like this for just 30-40 seconds.\n\nSprinkle with garlic powder and a little salt. Plate your creation by creating a bed of onions on the bottom, perching the chicken thighs on top, and decorating with the most beautiful pieces of onion on top.",

Transfer solids to small bowl and cool; set oil and solids aside.\n\nFollowing illustrations below, butterfly chicken, flatten breastbone, and tuck wings behind back. Using hands or handle of wooden spoon, loosen skin over breast and thighs and remove any excess fat. Combine 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in small bowl. Mix 3 teaspoons salt mixture with cooled garlic solids. Spread salt-garlic mixture evenly under skin over chicken breast and thighs. Sprinkle remaining teaspoon salt mixture on exposed meat of bone side. Place chicken skin-side up on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.\n\nTurn all burners to high. Wrap 2 bricks tightly in aluminum foil and place bricks on cooking grate. Heat with lid down until very hot, about 15 minutes. Scrape cooking grate clean. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).\n\nPlace chicken skin-side down over cooler side of grill with legs facing fire, place hot bricks lengthwise over each breast half, cover grill, and cook until skin is lightly browned and faint grill marks appear, 22 to 25 minutes. Remove bricks from chicken. Using tongs or towel, grip legs and flip chicken (chicken should release freely from grill; use thin metal spatula to loosen if stuck), skin-side up, with breast facing the cool part of the grill. Place bricks over breast, cover grill, and cook until chicken is well browned, 12 to 15 minutes.\n\nRemove bricks, flip chicken skin-side down over hot grates, and cook until chicken skin is well crisped and instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes, moving chicken as necessary to prevent flare-ups. Transfer chicken to cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Whisk lemon juice and remaining thyme and rosemary into reserved oil; season with salt and pepper.

    "description": null,
    "notes": "For the best flavor, use a high-quality chicken, such as Bell & Evans. Use an oven mitt or dish towel to safely grip and maneuver the hot bricks. If youre using table salt, reduce the amount to 1½ teaspoons in step 2. You will need two standard-sized bricks for this recipe. Placing the bricks on the chicken while it cooks ensures that the skin will be evenly browned and well rendereddont skip this step. A cast-iron skillet or other heavy pan can be used in place of the bricks.",

Add ancho mixture and chipotle; cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nAdd remaining 2 cups water, beans and their liquid, sugar, and tomato puree. Bring to boil, scraping bottom of pot to loosen any browned bits. Cover, transfer to oven, and cook until meat is tender and chili is slightly thickened, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.\n\nRemove chili from oven and let stand, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Stir in any fat that has risen to top of chili, then add vinegar and season with salt to taste. Serve, passing lime wedges, cilantro, and chopped onion separately. (Chili can be made up to 3 days in advance.)",

    "directions": "Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).\n\nRoll out refrigerated pie crust and line a 9- or 10-inch pie or quiche plate. Prick dough all over with the tines of a fork and crimp the edges between your thumb and forefinger so they form a pattern along the top edge of the plate. Place a piece of aluminum foil into tart shell and weight with pie weights, uncooked rice, or dried beans. Prebake shell until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sprinkle with salt. Cook, stirring, until onions are wilted and translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have softened completely and are lightly caramelized, another 20 minutes.

    "directions": "**For the Chicken Broth:**\nUsing a sharp knife, cut chicken breasts from breastbone and detach legs (drumstick with leg attached) from carcass. In a 7-quart pot or Dutch oven, combine the detached chicken breasts, legs, chicken carcass, celery, carrots, black peppercorns, bay leaves, salt, and water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook uncovered until chicken breasts register 160℉ (71ºC) with a digital thermometer, about 35 minutes, skimming any scum that rises to the surface.\n\nUsing tongs, remove chicken breasts and transfer to a cutting board. Continue simmering the chicken legs until the thighs and drumsticks are cooked and register 175℉ (80ºC) on an instant-read thermometer, another 15 minutes. Using tongs, remove thighs and drumsticks and transfer to cutting board. Simmer broth with remaining carcass until slightly reduced and broth develops a rich flavor, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let broth cool slightly, about 15 minutes.\n\nUsing tongs, remove chicken carcass and transfer to cutting board with breast and legs and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain broth into a large bowl or heat-proof container and discard solids; measure out 6 cups broth and set aside. Wipe pot clean. Cool and reserve the remaining broth for another use. (See notes.)\n\nUsing 2 large forks, shred breast, thigh, and drumstick meat, and any remaining meat from the chicken carcass into bite-size pieces. Transfer shredded meat to a bowl and discard bones and skin.\n\n**For the Soup: **\nIn now-empty pot or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Once melted, add onion, carrot, celery, thyme, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, 7 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with flour; cook, stirring constantly, until vegetables are evenly coated and flour begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nWhisk in the chicken stock, evaporated milk, salt, and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper as needed. Reduce heat to low to maintain a simmer while preparing the dumplings.\n\nFor the Dumplings: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, pepper, and thyme. Using a flexible spatula, incorporate sour cream, butter, and milk, stirring until fully combined. (Avoid over-mixing, which will result in tough dumplings.)\n\nStir the shredded chicken into the soup. Using 2 large spoons, work quickly to gently drop golf ball–size portions of dumpling dough into simmering soup; you should have about 15 dumplings. Some dumplings may dissolve slightly into the soup. This is OK as it will further thicken the soup. Cover and gently simmer until dumplings are fluffy, cooked through, and have doubled in size, about 10 minutes. Top with parsley and serve.",

    "ingredients": "1/2 cups all-purpose flour \nblack pepper \n8 chicken cutlets boneless, skinless (about 2 lbs.) \n1 tablespoons fresh sage minced (plus 8 extra leaves, optional) \n8 prosciutto thinly sliced, cut into 5- to 6-inch-long pieces to match chicken (about 3 ounces) \n4 tablespoons olive oil \n1 1/4 cups dry vermouth or white wine \n2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice \n4 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into 4 pieces and chilled \n1 tablespoons fresh parsley minced \ntable salt \n",
    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Combine flour and 1 teaspoon pepper in shallow dish.\n\nPat cutlets dry with paper towels. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off any excess. Lay cutlets flat and sprinkle evenly with minced sage. Place 1 prosciutto slice on top of each cutlet, pressing lightly to adhere; set aside.\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until beginning to shimmer. Add sage leaves (if using) and cook until leaves begin to change color and are fragrant, about 15 to 20 seconds. Using slotted spoon, remove sage to paper towel-lined plate; reserve. Add half of cutlets to pan, prosciutto-side down, and cook until light golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook on other side until light golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Transfer to wire rack set on rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and cutlets, then transfer to oven to keep warm while preparing sauce.\n\nPour off excess fat from skillet. Stir in vermouth, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer until reduced to about 1/3 cup, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Turn heat to low and whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Off heat, stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper. Remove chicken from oven and place on platter. Spoon sauce over cutlets before serving.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP\n\nSaltimbocca Made Simple\n\nFLOUR CHICKEN ONLY\n\nNo need to flour the prosciutto before sautéing, just the chicken.\n\nSPREAD SAGE FLAVOR\n\nSprinkling the cutlets with sage and topping with prosciutto distributes flavor evenly.\n\nFORGET THE TOOTHPICK\n\nSearing the cutlets prosciutto-side down first helps the ham stick.\n\nMAKE SAUCE\n\nStir the vermouth into the pan, reduce, and finish with butter. Spoon over cutlets.\n\n",

    "directions": "Use fresh Mexican-style chorizo here, not the dry-cured Spanish version. If you are spice averse, omit the cayenne pepper and reduce the chipotle chile to 1 tablespoon. To thaw frozen tater tots, either let them sit in the refrigerator for 24 hours or arrange them on a paper towel–lined plate and microwave them for 1½ minutes. It's important to follow the visual cues when making the eggs, as your skillet's thickness will affect the cooking time. If you're using an electric stovetop, heat a second burner on low and move the skillet to it when it's time to adjust the heat for the eggs. You can serve the burritos right after they're rolled, if you prefer, but we like the crispy texture the tortillas get from browning them in step 5.\n\nFOR THE CHIPOTLE SOUR CREAM: Stir all ingredients together in bowl; set aside.\n\nFOR THE BURRITOS: Heat 3 tablespoons oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add tater tots to skillet and press with spatula or underside of dry measuring cup to flatten slightly. Cook until crispy and deep golden brown, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer tater tots to paper towel–lined plate and set aside. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.\n\nCook chorizo in now-empty skillet over medium heat, breaking up meat with wooden spoon, until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Add eggs and, using heat-resistant rubber spatula, constantly and firmly scrape along bottom and sides of skillet until eggs begin to clump and spatula leaves trail on bottom of skillet, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low and add cheddar. Gently but constantly fold eggs until clumped and slightly wet, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove from heat and cover to keep warm.\n\nWrap tortillas in damp dish towel and microwave until warm and pliable, about 1 minute. Arrange tortillas on counter. Spread about 1½ tablespoons chipotle sour cream across bottom third of each tortilla, leaving 1-inch border. Divide tater tots and eggs evenly over chipotle sour cream. Working with 1 burrito at a time, fold sides of tortilla over filling, then fold up bottom of tortilla and roll tightly around filling.\n\nWipe skillet clean with paper towels. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in now-empty skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Arrange burritos in skillet seam side down and cook until crisp and golden, about 1 minute per side. Serve.",

You can serve the first batch immediately or tent them with foil to keep them warm.\n\nPulse ginger and garlic in food processor until finely chopped, 10 to 12 pulses, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Transfer ginger-garlic mixture to Dutch oven. Add honey; hoisin; soy sauce; ½ cup water; rice wine; five-spice powder; food coloring, if using; and pepper and whisk until combined. Add ribs and stir to coat (ribs will not be fully submerged). Bring to simmer over high heat, then reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 1¼ hours, stirring occasionally.\n\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Using tongs, transfer ribs to large bowl. Strain braising liquid through fine-mesh strainer set over large container, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. Let cooking liquid settle for 10 minutes. Using wide, shallow spoon, skim fat from surface and discard.\n\nReturn braising liquid to pot and add sesame oil. Bring to boil over high heat and cook until syrupy and reduced to 2½ cups, 16 to 20 minutes.\n\nSet wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and pour ½ cup water into sheet. Transfer half of ribs to pot with braising liquid and toss to coat. Arrange ribs, bone sides up, on prepared rack, letting excess glaze drip off. Roast until edges of ribs start to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip ribs and continue to roast until second side starts to caramelize, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer ribs to serving platter; repeat process with remaining ribs. Serve.",
    "description": "Chinese-style barbecued ribs are usually marinated for several hours and then slow-roasted and basted repeatedly to build up a thick crust. For a faster version, we cut the ribs into individual pieces (to speed cooking and create more surface area) and then braised them in a highly seasoned liquid, which helped the flavor penetrate thoroughly and quickly. Then we strained, defatted, and reduced the braising liquid to make a full-bodied glaze in which we tossed the ribs before roasting them on a rack in a hot oven to color and crisp their exteriors. ",

Pour the egg mixture into the muffin cups, filling each three-quarters of the way. If using any optional mix-ins, add them on top of each cup and, using a chopstick or small spoon, gently stir them into the mixture. Top with the remaining 1/2 cup shredded cheese and transfer to the oven. Carefully pour the hot water into the sheet pan just to cover the very bottom of the muffin cups.\n\nBake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the egg bites have set. Remove the muffin pan from the sheet pan of water in the oven and set aside for 5 minutes, then remove the bites from the pan. If using a silicone pan, they should pop right out. If not, use a butter knife or small offset spatula to run along the sides of the cups and gently lift them out. Egg bites will keep covered in the fridge for up to 3 days and in the freezer for up to 3 months. Reheat in a microwave or a 300-degree oven until warmed through.",

    "notes": "You can also make egg bites without the water bath. The egg bites will be firmer and more compact (rather than soft and fluffy), and they’ll brown on the bottom, like a frittata.\n\nMixins ideas:\n**Raw chopped vegetables**: onion, scallions, bell pepper or spinach (or a combination)\n**Cooked chopped vegetables**: mushrooms, broccoli, roasted red pepper, cauliflower, potato, sweet potato or butternut squash\n**Cooked chopped meat**: bacon or sausage\n**Finely chopped herbs**: basil, parsley, chives or cilantro\n\n2025-04-09 Made. Used some sautéed onions and mushrooms. Very good. Try adding some sausage or bacon next time.\n",

    "directions": "Make the marinade: Add the garlic, ginger, mint, cilantro, lemon juice and 3 tablespoons oil to a large resealable bag. Seal the bag and massage to combine the ingredients into a paste. Add the coriander, turmeric, amchur (if using), red chile powder and salt, and seal the bag. Shake or massage to combine.\n\nPlace the chicken breasts in the marinade and seal the bag tightly. Use your hands to gently massage the marinade onto the chicken breasts until each breast is coated. Refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\n\nWarm a large lidded skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is quite hot, add the oil, swirling the pan to coat the entire surface. Reduce the heat to medium, remove the chicken from the marinade and shake gently to remove any excess marinade. Add it to the pan. Working in batches if necessary, cook the breasts, undisturbed, until lightly golden underneath, 1 to 2 minutes, then flip them and cook until lightly golden on the second side, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nReduce the heat to low, cover, and cook the chicken for 10 minutes (no peeking!). Turn off the heat (if you have an electric stove, take the pan off the heat) and let the chicken sit, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the breasts. Don’t lift the lid, or you’ll release the hot steam that finishes cooking the chicken.\n\nCheck to make sure the breasts are cooked through: There shouldn’t be any pink in the middle. If you have a meat thermometer, the chicken should register at least 165 degrees. Place the chicken on a cutting board, and slice each breast into strips. Garnish with mint and cilantro.",

My two sons were staying with me also, and we cooked some homemade pizzas. It was a good time. \nAs of late, me and the boys have been camping more often in northwest Georgia, like Cloudland Canyon. I've done some trips to Sipsey Wilderness area. Love that part of the world too. I grew up in Chattanooga, so I love going into the TN/NC mountains when I can find the time.\nSo I see from one of your photos that you were snokeling or diving? Where was that?

Reserve about 2 cups of the pasta cooking liquid, then drain; set aside.\n\n02 In the same pot over medium-high, combine 1 tablespoon oil and the pancetta. Cook, stirring, until it has rendered some of its fat and begins to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it into small pieces, until browned, about 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer half of the pancetta-sausage mixture to a small bowl; set aside.\n\n03 Into the pancetta-sausage mixture in the pot, stir the tomatoes. Bring to a simmer over medium and cook, stirring, until thickened, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in 1 cup of the reserved pasta water, then the pasta. Cook, stirring and tossing, until the pasta is al dente, 3 to 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the egg and yolks, pecorino, 1 teaspoon pepper and ¼ cup of the reserved pasta water.\n\n04 Remove the pot from the heat. Add the egg mixture and reserved pancetta-sausage mixture. Stir until the sauce thickens slightly and clings to the pasta, about 2 minutes. If needed, add reserved cooking water 1 tablespoon at a time to adjust the consistency. Taste and season with salt. Serve sprinkled with additional pepper and cheese and drizzled with additional oil.",

    "directions": "Combine shallots and oil in a wok or medium nonstick saucepan. Shallots should barely stick out above level of oil. Place over high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until shallots are completely soft, about 12 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, line a rimmed baking sheet with 6 layers of paper towels. Continue to cook shallots, stirring constantly, until shallots are light golden brown, about 8 minutes.\n\nImmediately strain through a fine-mesh strainer set in a heat-proof bowl or saucepan. Set shallot oil aside. You should have about 2 cups of fried shallots.\n\nTransfer fried shallots to paper towels. Lift up one end of top paper towel and roll shallots off onto second. Blot with first towel to absorb excess oil. Repeat 4 more times, transferring shallots from one paper towel to the next, until only one paper towel remains. Season well with salt.\n\nAllow shallots to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Once they've cooled, transfer to a sealed airtight container. Shallots can be made up to 1 month in advance.\n\nSmash mushrooms under the bottom of a large skillet until broken into 1/4- to 1/2-inch pieces. Roughly chop into pieces approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch in size. Set aside.\n\nCombine soy sauce, lemon juice, chicken stock, and heavy cream in a 1-quart liquid measuring cup or medium bowl.\n\nAdd 2 tablespoons (30ml) reserved shallot oil (save remainder in an airtight container for another use) and butter to a 12-inch nonstick skillet. Heat over high heat until butter is melted and foaming subsides. Add mushrooms to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated and mushrooms begin to sizzle, 6 to 10 minutes.\n\nReduce heat to medium-high. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until light golden blond, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisking constantly, add stock and cream mixture.\n\nBring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until mixture achieves a texture between pancake batter and heavy cream, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Bring 1 gallon (3.8L) water and 1/4 cup (48g) kosher salt to a boil over high heat. Fill a large bowl with 1 quart ice cubes and 2 quarts (1.9L) water.\n\nAdd green beans to water and boil until tender but still bright green, about 5 minutes. Drain through a colander set over the sink and immediately transfer to ice water until completely cooled. Drain green beans and set aside.\n\nCombine green beans, mushroom sauce, and 1 cup fried shallots. Transfer to a 9- by 13-inch rectangular baking dish or a 10- by 14-inch oval baking dish. Bake until hot and bubbly, 15 to 20 minutes. Top with remaining cup fried shallots and serve.",

Season generously with kosher salt and toss to combine.\n\n2. Transfer contents to a vacuum bag and seal.\n\n3. When ready to cook, set sous vide cooker to desired temperature according to chart above.\n\n4. Add bag to sous vide bath and cook for recommended time according to chart above. Make sure to top water up occasionally as it evaporates, and keep bag completely submerged. If bag floats, weigh it down by placing a wet kitchen towel on top of it. Alternatively, use a heavy-duty binder clip to attach a metal spoon or knife to bottom of bag as a weight.\n\n5. When meat is cooked, remove from water bath and transfer contents of bag to a large bowl. Pick out chunks of meat with a set of tongs and transfer them to a rimmed baking sheet. (Discard aromatics and excess liquid, or reserve liquid and blend it in with your salsa.) When it is cool enough to handle, shred meat roughly using 2 forks or your fingers. Spread evenly over baking sheet. Pork can be prepared up to this point and refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 5 days before serving.\n\n6. When ready to serve, adjust an oven rack to 3 inches below the broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Place pork under broiler and cook, using a spoon to flip pieces occasionally, until meat is browned and crisp on most sides, about 10 minutes total. Alternatively, working in batches, heat carnitas in a cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes.\n\n7.

    "name": "Hummus Fatteh (Hummus with Crisp Pita, Fried Meat, and Pine Nuts)",
    "ingredients": "For the Fatteh:\n1 1/4 cups dried chickpeas (8 ounces; 226g), see notes\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n9 ounces thin pita (about 3 thin 8-inch pitas), cut into 3/4-inch squares (250g; about 4 1/2 cups)\n1 cup tahini (about 8 1/2 ounces; 240g)\n1 large clove garlic (10g), finely minced\n1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume\n1 cup full-fat Greek-style or plain yogurt (about 8 1/2 ounces; 241g)\n1/4 cup (60ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice from 2 lemons\nFor the Lemon Dressing:\n1 large clove garlic (10g), finely minced\n1 medium green chile such as jalapeño or Anaheim (1 3/4 ounce; 50g), seeded, stemmed, and finely diced\n2 tablespoons (30ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice from 1 lemon\n2 tablespoons (30ml) extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling\nKosher salt\nFor the Meat:\n3 tablespoons (45ml) extra-virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon (15ml) unsalted butter or ghee\n1/3 cup pine nuts (1 1/2 ounces; 42g)\n1 pound (454g) lamb loin, beef tenderloin, or other tender and flavorful quick-cooking steak, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n1 teaspoon Lebanese 7 spice or baharat (see notes)\nKosher salt\nFor Serving:\n2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf parsley\nRed pepper flakes or pomegranate seeds (optional)",
    "directions": "For the Fatteh: In a large bowl, cover chickpeas with 6 cups (1.4L) cold water. Let stand at room temperature for at least 8 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse chickpeas thoroughly.\n\nIn a 6- to 8-quart Dutch oven or saucepan, combine chickpeas and cumin. Add enough water to cover by 2 inches (about 8 cups; about 1.9L) and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer, cover with lid slightly ajar, and cook until chickpeas are completely tender but not falling apart, 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. Check on chickpeas, stirring occasionally, and top off with more water if needed; chickpeas should be fully submerged at all times. (See notes if using canned chickpeas.)\n\nMeanwhile: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350ºF (175ºC). Place sliced pita on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to oven. Toast, using a spoon or spatula to turn pita occasionally, until squares are completely dry and crisp and starting to darken in color, about 15 minutes. Remove and set aside until ready to use.\n\nIn a medium bowl, stir tahini, garlic, salt, yogurt, and lemon juice together until smooth; the sauce should be thick and sticky. When chickpeas are done, add 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup of chickpea cooking liquid to bowl with tahini mixture and whisk well to incorporate. The sauce should have a consistency similar to maple syrup: thick but easily pourable. Set aside until ready to assemble.\n\nFor the Lemon Dressing: In a small bowl, combine garlic, green chile, lemon juice, and extra-virgin olive oil. Whisk well to combine and season to taste with salt. Set aside.\n\nFor the Meat: n a 10-inch skillet, heat olive oil and butter over medium heat until butter has melted. Add pine nuts and toast until light golden brown and fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes. Using a fine-mesh sieve, immediately strain nuts over a small bowl and transfer to a paper-towel lined plate. Set aside. Return fat to pan. Increase heat to medium-high and add lamb or beef and season with spices and salt. Cook, stirring occasionally until meat is nicely browned and cooked through, about 4 minutes. Season to taste with salt.\n\nTo Assemble: Arrange toasted pita on a large, deep serving platter and spoon half of the lemon dressing on top of the pita. Using a ladle, scoop chickpeas, along with about 1/2 cup of their cooking liquid, over the bread, reserving 2 tablespoons of chickpeas to garnish with. (You want the bread to soak up the liquid but not become a mushy mess.)\n\nPour the tahini and yogurt mixture evenly over the chickpeas. Top with the fried meat and pine nuts. Garnish with the reserved chickpeas, chopped parsley, and pomegranate seeds, if using. Drizzle the remaining lemon dressing over and top with more olive oil if desired. Serve warm.",

    "directions": "1. Adjust oven rack to upper middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Bake potatoes on foil-lined baking sheet until skin is crisp and deep brown and skewer easily pierces flesh, about 1 hour. Setting baking sheet aside, transfer potatoes to wire rack and let sit until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.\n\n2. Heat butter in medium skillet over medium heat; sauté onion until soft, 3 to 4 minutes, and set aside.\n\n3. Following illustration below, using an oven mitt or folded kitchen towel to handle hot potatoes, cut each potato in half so that blunt sides will rest on work surface. Using a small dinner spoon, scoop flesh from each half into medium bowl, leaving a 1/8-inch to 1/4-inch thickness of flesh in each shell. Arrange shells on lined sheet and return to oven until dry and slightly crisped, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, mash potato flesh with fork until smooth. Stir in remaining ingredients, including pepper to taste, until well combined.\n\n4. Remove shells from oven and increase oven setting to broil. Holding shells steady on pan with oven mitt or towel-protected hand, spoon mixture into crisped shells, mounding slightly at the center, and return to oven. Broil until spotty brown and crisp on top, 10 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes. Serve warm.",
    "description": "We had a head start on our twice-baked potato recipe, having already developed a recipe for the Best Baked Potato. Starting there, we let the baked potatoes cool slightly before slicing them open and removing the flesh. We found that we could keep the skins from turning soggy and flabby by keeping them in the oven while making the filling. And for the filling we found it best to combine the potato with a tangy dairy ingredient like sour cream or yogurt, a small amount of butter, and ingredients with strong flavors like cheddar cheese, bacon, or chipotle peppers. For a perfect finish, we placed the filled potatoes under the broiler, where they turned brown and crisp.",

    "name": "Sous Vide Smoked Brisket",
    "ingredients": "2 ounces coarsely ground black peppercorns (about 1/3 cup; 55g) (see note)\n2 1/4 ounces kosher salt (about 1/4 cup; 65g)\n1/4 ounce (10g) pink salt (optional; see note)\n1 flat-cut or point-cut brisket, about 5 pounds (2.25kg)(see note)\n1/4 teaspoon liquid smoke (optional; see note)\nDill pickles, sliced yellow onion, and white bread, for serving",
    "directions": "1. Combine pepper, salt, and pink salt (if using) in a small bowl. Rub 2/3 of mixture evenly over surface of brisket. Reserve remaining 1/3 of mixture. Slice brisket in half crosswise in order to fit into large vacuum bags.\n\n2. Place each brisket half in a vacuum bag. (Fold over the top of each bag while you add brisket so that no rub or juices get on the edges of bags, which can weaken the seal.) Add 4 drops (about 1/8 teaspoon) of liquid smoke to each bag, if using. Seal bags using a vacuum sealer and let rest for 2 to 3 hours in the refrigerator.\n\n3. Set your precision cooker to 135°F (57°C) for brisket with a tender, steak-like texture, or 155°F (68°C) for more traditionally textured brisket that falls apart when you pull at it. Add brisket to water bath and cover it with a lid, aluminum foil, or table tennis balls. Cook for 24 to 36 hours at 155°F or 36 to 72 hours at 135°F. Allow cooked brisket to cool at least to room temperature before proceeding (an ice bath can speed up this process). Brisket can be stored in the refrigerator at this stage for up to 1 week before finishing.\n\n4. To Finish on the Grill: Light 1/2 chimney full of charcoal. When all charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange coals on one side of charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill, and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to medium-high heat, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil grilling grate.\n\n5. Remove brisket from bags and carefully blot dry with paper towels. (Liquid from bags can be added to your favorite barbecue sauce and simmered down to provide extra flavor.) Rub reserved salt and pepper mixture into surface of brisket. Place brisket on cooler side of grill, fat cap-up. Add 4 to 5 hardwood chunks to hotter side of grill. (If using a gas grill, wrap wood chunks loosely in aluminum foil before placing over hotter side of grill.) Cover and allow brisket to smoke, adjusting vents to maintain a temperature between 275 and 300°F, and adding 2 to 3 wood chunks twice during cooking. Smoke until a deep, dark bark has formed, about 3 hours. Continue with step 7.\n\n6. To Finish in the Oven: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F. (If your oven has a convection setting, turn it on and adjust heat to 275°F instead.) Remove brisket from sous vide bags and carefully blot dry with paper towels. (Liquid from bags can be added to your favorite barbecue sauce and simmered down to provide extra flavor.) Rub reserved salt and pepper mixture into surface of brisket. Place brisket on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, fat cap-up, and place in oven. Roast until a deep, dark bark has formed, about 2 hours. Continue with step 7.\n\n7. Transfer brisket to a cutting board and tent with foil. Allow to rest until the temeperature drops to between 145 and 165°F, about 30 minutes. Slice against the grain into thin strips and serve with white bread, dill pickles, and sliced onion.",

    "description": "With all due respect to stuffed, breaded, and fried jalapeño poppers, we wanted an easier option to bring this bar snack to the home kitchen. But perfecting baked jalapeño poppers took a few tricks. First, roasting the halved chiles cut side down lets us control the texture of the peppers and drives off excess moisture. For a flavorful filling that isn’t chalky, equal parts cream cheese, cheddar, and Monterey Jack are our cheeses of choice, while panko bread crumbs and an egg yolk help it stay put. Finally, for a filling that stands up to the fiery jalapeños, we add scallions, cilantro, cumin, lime, and bacon. ",

    "directions": "01 In a medium bowl, combine 1 tablespoon of the soy sauce, the flour, 2 tablespoons water, ¼ teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon black pepper; whisk until smooth. Add the chicken and toss to coat; set aside.\n\n02 In a small bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons soy sauce, chili paste, sugar, oyster sauce and 3 tablespoons water, then whisk until the sugar dissolves; set the sauce aside.\n\n03 In a 12- to 14-inch wok or 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering.

Using 1 tablespoon of the remaining oil, cook the remaining chicken mixture in the same way and transfer to the bowl with the first batch.\n\n05 Return the pan to medium-high and add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, garlic and pepper flakes; cook, stirring, until the garlic is golden brown, about 30 seconds. Add the onion and cook, stirring and scraping, until just beginning to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the chicken and accumulated juices, then pour the sauce mixture down the sides of the pan. Cook, stirring and scraping, until the sauce thickens slightly and lightly coats the chicken and onion, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the scallions and cashews with árbol chilies (if used); cook, stirring, until the scallions are just wilted, about 30 seconds. Remove from the heat. Taste and season with salt and black pepper.",
    "description": "The Thai stir-fried cashew chicken, or gai pad med mamuang himmaphan, that home cook and food blogger Rawadee Yenchujit taught us in her Bangkok kitchen was a revelation. Deliciously filled with contrasting tastes and textures and with balanced savoriness, sweetness and spice plus loads of umami, it bore little resemblance to the goopy, sugary dish Thai restaurants tend to serve in the U.S. We opted to skip shallow-­frying the chicken as we were taught in Bangkok, and instead stir-fry it in batches, which requires a fraction of the oil. We also chose to include onion and scallions as the only vegetables, allowing the chicken and cashews to be front and center. We tried to do without Thai chili paste, or chili “jam”—nam prik pao, in Thai—but we discovered it’s an important element in the stir-fry. The mixture is thick, dark red and rather oily. Made by blending fried shallots, garlic, dried chilies, shrimp paste, tamarind and other ingredients, the paste is intensely and inimitably flavorful. Thai Kitchen roasted chili paste is sold in small jars in the international aisle of most supermarkets. Whole árbol chilies bring spiciness and aroma that supplements the red pepper flakes, but they’re optional, so feel free to leave them out. Steamed jasmine rice is the perfect accompaniment.",

    "directions": "For the crust: \n\nMix all the ingredients in a small bowl.\n\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Using kitchen shears or a sharp knife, cut alongside the backbone of the chicken to split it open. Spread and press on the chicken with your hands to flatten it. Using a sharp paring knife, cut halfway through both sides of the joints connecting the thighs and drumsticks and cut through the joints of the shoulder under the wings as well. (This will help the heat penetrate these joints and accelerate the cooking process.)\n\nPut the chicken skin side down on a cutting board and spread it with about half the mustard mixture. Place the chicken flat in a large skillet, mustard side down. Spread the remaining mustard on the skin side of the chicken. Cook over high heat for about 5 minutes, then place the skillet in the oven and cook the chicken for about 30 minutes. It should be well browned and dark on top.\n\nLet the chicken rest in the skillet at room temperature for a few minutes, then cut it into 8 pieces with clean kitchen shears. Deglaze skillet with chicken stock. Defat the cooking juices and add back to sauce. \n\nPour some sauce on the chicken and serve.\n\n",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "I often make this recipe at home when I am in a hurry, because splitting and flattening the chicken and cutting between the joints of the leg and the shoulder reduce the cooking time by half. I use kitchen shears to split the chicken pen at the back and to cut the cooked bird into serving pieces and a knife to cut between the joints.\n\rThe mustard crust can be made ahead and even spread on the chicken a day ahead, if you like. I pour the cooked chicken juices into a fat separator with a spout and serve over Fluffy Mashed Potatoes, leaving the fat behind.",

    "directions": "1. Sprinkle pieces of meat with 1 tablespoon salt (1½ teaspoons if using table salt), place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet, and let stand at room temperature 1 hour.\n\n2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Heat 2 tablespoons butter in heavy-bottomed Dutch oven over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and beginning to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add carrot and celery, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes longer. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 1 cup broth, ½ cup beer, porcinis, prunes, bay leaf, and thyme sprig; bring to simmer.\n\n3. Pat beef dry with paper towels and season generously with pepper. Using three pieces of kitchen twine, tie each piece of meat into round loaf shape.\n\n4. Nestle roasts on top of vegetables. Place large piece of foil over pot and cover tightly with lid; transfer pot to oven. Cook roasts until fully tender and sharp knife easily slips in and out of meat, 3 1/2 to 4 hours, turning roast halfway through cooking.\n\n5. Transfer roasts to cutting board and tent loosely with foil. Strain liquid through mesh strainer into 4-cup liquid measuring cup. Discard thyme sprig and bay leaf. Transfer vegetables to pitcher of blender. Allow liquid to settle for 5 minutes then skim any fat off surface. Add beef broth as necessary to bring total amount of liquid to 3 cups. Place liquid in blender pitcher with vegetables and blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Transfer sauce to medium saucepan and bring to simmer over medium heat.\n\n6. While sauce is heating, heat remaining 2 tablespoons unsalted butter in 12-inch skillet over medium heat. When foaming subsides add cremini mushrooms and cook, stirring frequently, until all liquid has evaporated and mushrooms have started to brown, 7 to 10 minutes.\n\n7. Remove twine from roast and slice against grain into ½-inch-thick slices. Transfer meat to large serving platter. Stir chopped thyme, remaining ¼ cup beer, and sautéed creminis into sauce and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately, serving sauce separately.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: We started our pot roast recipe by choosing well-marbled chuck-eye roast, which is full of collagen and well suited for braising. Opening the pot roast and trimming away the excess interior fat got rid of the pesky globs that refused to render as the pot roast cooked. Leaving the meat in two smaller roasts also shaved cooking time from our pot roast recipe and allowed the salt we used to season the lobes to penetrate even further. And finally, roasted vegetables thickened the pot roast’s gravy and glutamate-rich ingredients beefed up its rich flavor.",

    "directions": "1. Wrappers: Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl. Mix/knead to form a slightly sticky dough.\r2. Divide into 12.\r3. Roll out each ball between two sheets of wax paper as thin as possible.\r4. Stack the rolled wrappers in a bowl with wax paper between each. Cover the bowl with a wet towel. This will keep them from drying out while you prepare the rest.\r5. Sauce: Combine all the ingredients in a jar. Shake.\r6. Filling: Add all the veggies to a non-stick skillet over medium high\rheat.\r7. Once they begin to sizzle, add about 1/3 cup of water, cover the pan, and let them steam for 4-5 minutes over medium heat till soft.\r8. Remove the cover, add the sauce mixture, and stir until everything comes together and all additional water has evaporated. About 1-2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool for 5-10 minutes.\r9. To assemble: Remove one wrapper from the bowl with the wax paper that is underneath it. Spoon about a teaspoon of filling into the center of the wrapper.\r10. Fold in half and press the edges together firmly. Optionally crimp the edges. Using the wax paper to do this will prevent the wrapper from sticking to your finger as it is prone to do if they are even slightly wet/moist.\r11. Repeat with the remaining wrappers.\r12. To steam: Fill a shallow pan with enough water to completely cover the bottom. Bring to a boil. Add half of your dumplings. Cover and steam for 5-6 minutes. Remove from the pan. Repeat with the second half.\r13. Serve plain or with dipping sauce of your choice.",

Cover and set aside until ready to serve.\n\n02 To make the rolls, in a medium bowl, combine the pork, fish sauce and soy sauce. Mix with your hands until well combined; set aside. In a 10-inch skillet over medium, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil until shimmering. Add the shallots and ½ teaspoon salt; cook, stirring, until well browned, about 10 minutes.

Transfer to the bowl with the shallot mixture and cool to room temperature.\n\n04 Add the scallions and ½ teaspoon white pepper. Mix by hand, breaking up any large chunks of pork, until cohesive. Taste and season with additional pepper.\n\n05 Mist a rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray. Set a wide bowl of warm water nearby, along with the pork-rice filling, carrot, lettuce and basil. Soak 1 rice paper wrapper in the warm water until starting to soften, about 5 seconds. Lay it flat on a cutting board or countertop. Lay 3 carrot ribbons across the bottom third of the rice paper, overlapping slightly (trim them if they overhang). Press down on the spine of one lettuce leaf to flatten, then place it over the carrots, tearing it to fit.\n\n06 Top the lettuce with ¼ cup of the pork filling, then top with a bit of basil. Fold the lower part of the wrapper up and over the filling and roll tightly, just until the filling is enclosed. Fold in the sides of the wrapper over the filling, then continue rolling to create a tight bundle. Set on the prepared baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Serve right away or store at room temperature, covered with plastic wrap, for up to 2 hours; if desired, cut the rolls in half just before serving. Serve the dipping sauce on the side.",

    "ingredients": "",
    "directions": "Soaked Granola\n\nfor soaking:\n\n6 cups rolled oats\n1 cup whole wheat flour (alternative flours ok)\n1 cup unsweetened dried coconut\n1 cup coconut oil\n1/4 cup water\n6 Tbsp plain yogurt or whey (the liquid that separates from yogurt)\n2 cups raw almonds\n1 1/2 cups very warm water\nIn a very large bowl, toss together the oats, flour, and coconut. Warm the coconut oil and water together (stovetop or microwave) until they stir easily. Add the yogurt, and stir vigorously to emulsify as much as possible. Pour this liquid over the oats, and stir to thoroughly coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap or a large plate, and let sit in a warm place for 8-12 hours (I cover it very tightly with plastic wrap and place it in my food dehydrator, set at about 95º).\n\nIn a separate, smaller bowl, combine the almonds and water. Cover and let soak for about 8 hours.\n\nfor the final mixing and baking:\n\n1/2 cup honey\n1/4 cup water\n1/4 cup sucanat or honey\n1 1/2 tsp salt\n1 tsp vanilla extract\nPreheat oven to 300º, and oil or butter two large sheet pans. Have oven racks in two outer-middle positions.\n\nDrain the soaked almonds, and slip off the skins (discard). Chop the almonds finely, and add to the soaked oats. Stir to combine — this will be difficult at first if your oats have been in a cold kitchen (the coconut oil re-solidifies and clumps everything together).\n\nWarm together the honey, water, and sucanat. Add the salt and vanilla, and stir to dissolve. Pour this liquid over the oats/almonds, and stir to coat.\n\nDivide evenly between baking sheets, spreading to the edges, pressing down gently to pack it into the pans. Bake for about 25 minutes. Remove pans, and flip/stir the granola in each pan. Return pans to oven, switching top to bottom and front to back, and continue cooking for another 20 minutes. Stir again, and return to oven if necessary. Once desired color is reached, remove pans and turn off the oven. After oven has cooled for about 10 minutes, you can return the pans to the oven to let sit overnight. Otherwise, let cool completely in the pans before serving (granola will get crisper as it cools).",

    "name": "This Mexican Pork Ribs Recipe Has Been a Family Favorite for Generations",
    "ingredients": "**For the Ribs:**\n2 pounds (905g) pork sparerib chunks or use one 2 1/2 pound-rack pork spareribs, membrane removed, halved crosswise and cut into 1-bone sections (see notes)\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n**For the Salsa**:\n1/2 large white onion, peeled (5 ounces; 142g)\n4 plum tomatoes, halved (450g)\n2 jalapeño chiles, stemmed and halved\n5 medium cloves garlic (25g)\n1 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder\n1 teaspoon black peppercorns\n1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds\nKosher salt\n\n**For Serving**:\n1 recipe cooked white rice\n1 recipe Perfect Frijoles Refritos\nCrema\nCotija cheese\nThinly sliced scallions, optional",
    "directions": "For the Ribs: Generously season pork with kosher salt and pepper. Set meat on a large plate or on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 4 hours or up to 12 hours.\n\nIn a large stockpot or Dutch oven, bring two quarts of water to a boil over high heat. Place a parchment-lined steamer basket above the water. Spread the ribs in an even layer in the steamer. Steam, covered, checking and maintaining water at a simmer and topping off with more water as needed, about every 20 minutes, until the ribs are tender when pierced with a paring knife or fork, but not spoon tender, 60 to 90 minutes. Set the meat aside to cool.\n\nOnce cool enough to handle, using a fork, wiggle and push the bones out of the ribs. Use your fingers to feel for any remaining small bits of bone in the pork and use kitchen shears to trim them out if needed. (If preferred, you can leave the bones in the ribs.)\n\nFor the Salsa: Meanwhile, adjust the oven rack to upper position, 6 to 8 inches away from the broiler, and preheat broiler. Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper and spread the onion, tomatoes, jalapeños, and garlic in an even layer. Broil until deeply charred, about 7 minutes, then flip all the ingredients and broil until charred on second side, 3 minutes longer.\n\nIn a blender, blend the charred onion, tomatoes, jalapeños, garlic, chicken bouillon powder, black peppercorns, and cumin seeds on high speed until smooth, stopping to scrape down sides of blender jar as needed, about 1 minute. Season to taste with salt.\n\nFor Serving: In a 12-inch sauté pan or stainless-steel or nonstick skillet, add oil and deboned pork and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally until browned and crisped all over, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the prepared sauce and stir to completely coat the meat and cook until sauce is warmed through and clings to the ribs, 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nTo assemble, add rice to the bottom of individual serving bowls. Top it with the prepared beans, the ribs with their sauce, crema, cotija, and scallions. Drizzle a couple additional spoonfuls of the rib sauce onto each plate.",

    "directions": "You can serve the chicken on the bone, but we prefer to carve it off and slice it before serving.\n\n1. Starting on thick side of breast, closest to breastbone, cut horizontal pocket in each breast, stopping ½ inch from edge so halves remain attached. Dissolve 3 tablespoons salt in 1 quart cold water in large container. Add breasts, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 30 minutes.\n\n2. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal (6 quarts, about 100 briquettes) and allow to burn until coals are fully ignited and partially covered with thin layer of ash, about 20 minutes. Arrange all coals over half of grill, leaving other half empty. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate until hot, about 5 minutes. Scrape grate clean with grill brush. Dip wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe cooking grate. Grill is ready when coals are hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above grate for 2 seconds).\n\n3. Meanwhile, combine butter, shallot, and tarragon in small bowl. Roll each piece of cheese in 1 slice prosciutto. Remove breasts from brine, dry thoroughly inside and out with paper towels, and season inside and out with pepper. Spread equal amount of butter mixture inside each breast. Place 1 prosciutto-wrapped piece of cheese inside each breast and fold breast over to enclose. Evenly space 3 pieces kitchen twine (each about 12 inches long) beneath each breast and tie, trimming any excess.\n\n4. Place chicken breasts, skin side down, over hot part of grill and cook until well browned, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip chicken and cook until second side is just opaque, about 2 minutes. Move chicken, skin side up, to cool side of grill, with thicker side of breasts facing fire. Cover grill and continue to cook until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of stuffing registers 160 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes.

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For our charcoal-grilled stuffed chicken recipe’s stuffing, we opted for prosciutto and fontina. We wrapped the prosciutto around the cheese and placed the whole bundle inside the chicken, which we had sliced horizontally and spread with a simple compound butter. Bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts stayed moist, and the bone prevented shrinking and shielded the underside of the meat from the heat of the grill, giving us a stuffed chicken breast recipe that was made better by the grill, not worse.

    "ingredients": "8 large eggs\n¼ teaspoon table salt\n¾ cup cabbage kimchi, drained and chopped coarse\n¼ cup mayonnaise\n4 kaiser rolls, halved and lightly toasted\n¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro\n1 ripe avocado, halved, pitted, and sliced thin",
    "directions": "This recipe requires an 8-inch square metal baking pan. Avoid using a ceramic or glass dish, which will increase the cooking time and could cause the eggs to overcook during cooling. We like the flavor and texture of kaiser rolls for these sandwiches, but you can substitute 4-inch bulkie rolls, English muffins, or burger buns, if desired. If you omit the kimchi from your sandwiches, you may want to season the eggs with additional salt after baking. For maximum efficiency, gather and prepare the sandwich fillings while the eggs cook, and toast the rolls while the eggs cool. Alternatively, let the eggs cool completely after cutting them, stack them in an airtight container, and refrigerate them for up to three days. To reheat, arrange the egg squares on a large plate and microwave at 50 percent power until they're warm, 2 to 3 minutes.\n\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Whisk eggs and salt in large bowl until well combined. Whisk in ⅔ cup water. Spray 8-inch square baking pan with vegetable oil spray. Pour egg mixture into prepared pan and set pan on rimmed baking sheet. Add 1½ cups water to sheet. Transfer sheet to oven and bake until eggs are fully set, 35 to 40 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. While eggs bake, blot kimchi with paper towels. Remove pan from sheet, transfer to wire rack, and let cool for 10 minutes.\n\nRun knife around edges of pan and, using dish towel or oven mitts, invert eggs onto cutting board (if eggs stick to pan, tap bottom of pan firmly to dislodge). Cut into 4 equal squares. Spread mayonnaise on roll bottoms. Sprinkle cilantro over mayonnaise. Using spatula, transfer 1 egg square to each sandwich. Top each egg square with avocado and then kimchi. Set roll tops over kimchi and serve.",

    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C) (or 400°F (200°C) if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.\n\nMeanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.\n\nWhen potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.\n\nTransfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.\n\nTransfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.",

    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: To save time and boost flavor, we ditched the original marinade and made a paste of the prunes, olives, capers, garlic, and oregano, which we spread on the chicken and caramelized into the sauce. To boost meatiness and complexity, we added anchovies and pepper flakes and browned the chicken skin in a skillet before baking it through.\n\n1. FOR THE PASTE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Pulse all ingredients in food processor until finely chopped, about ten 1-second pulses. Scrape down bowl and continue to process until mostly smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to bowl. (Paste can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)\n2. FOR THE CHICKEN: Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Sprinkle chicken pieces with 1½ teaspoons salt and season with pepper.\n3. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook without moving it until well browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer chicken to large plate. Drain off all but 1 teaspoon fat from skillet and return to medium-low heat.\n4. Add 1/3 cup paste to skillet and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant and fond forms on pan bottom, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in broth, wine, olives, capers, and bay leaves, scraping up any browned bits. Return chicken to pan, skin side up (skin should be above surface of liquid), and roast, uncovered, for 15 minutes.\n5. Remove skillet from oven and use back of spoon to spread remaining paste over chicken pieces; sprinkle prunes around chicken. Continue to roast until paste begins to brown, breasts register 160 degrees, and leg quarters register 175 degrees, 7 to 12 minutes longer.\n6. Transfer chicken to serving platter and tent loosely with aluminum foil. Remove bay leaves from sauce and whisk in butter, vinegar, and 1 tablespoon parsley; season with salt and pepper to taste. Pour sauce around chicken, sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon parsley, and serve.",

This is an important step, too hot, and your yogurt won't culture and be tangy, you need the correct temperature so you don't kill the live cultures! Too cold, and they won't grow, so the 100F is important.\n\nOnce the coconut milk is the right temperature, whisk in the starter a little at a time, no lumps. You want it nice and smooth.\n\nPress the \"Yogurt\" button and adjust the time, the longer you set the timer, the tangier it will be. 8 hours is just how I like it, I turn it on before bed, it's ready by morning!\n\nWhile it is still warm, whisk in the gelatin a little at a time, again you don't want clumps.\n\nPour equally into the jars leaving room for the desired toppings, (you can put the topping on the bottom of course and pour the warm yogurt over top).\n\nPut on the lid and refrigerate 4-6 hours, it will set up to a thick tangy geek style coconut yogurt.\n\nMix well before serving.",

Cool until handleable and, if you wish, pull off the blackened skin from the tomatoes.\n\nRoughly chop the habanero(s) and scoop them into a blender or food processor, followed by the tomatoes. Pulse to roughly chop everything, then run the machine until you have what I’d call a very coarse puree—not too chunky, certainly not smooth. Scrape the mixture into a salsa dish. Chop the onion into small bits and stir them in, along with the cilantro and a good dose of salt—it usually takes nearly a teaspoon. If the salsa is too thick to easily spoon, stir in a tablespoon or two of water.",

    "directions": "Trim root ends and dark green parts from leeks; discard roots. Quarter white and light green parts lengthwise, then slice crosswise into 1½-inch pieces; wash thoroughly. (You should have about 3 cups white and light green parts). Cut dark green parts into 4- to 6-inch pieces and wash thoroughly.\n\nBring 2 quarts water, pork, ginger, and dark green leek parts to boil in large saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, adjusting heat as needed to maintain gentle simmer, until pork skin and fat can be easily pierced with paring knife, 30 to 40 minutes. (Add water as needed to keep pork submerged.) Transfer pork to plate and let cool completely, about 15 minutes; discard cooking liquid and solids. Cover pork with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or up to 24 hours. Place pork skin side down on cutting board and slice as thin as possible (⅛ to ¼ inch thick).\n\nHeat oil in 14-inch wok or 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add pork and cook, stirring constantly, until meat is just beginning to brown and some fat has rendered, 2 to 4 minutes. Stir in douchi and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\n\nSlide pork mixture to 1 side of wok and briefly tilt wok to let oil pool on opposite side. Stir Pixian dòubànjiàng and tiánmiànjiàng into pooled oil (oil may splatter) and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is fragrant and oil has turned red, about 30 seconds. Stir pork into oil mixture.\n\nStir in white and light green leek parts; longhorn chiles, if using; soy sauce; and sugar. Cook, stirring constantly, until leeks are tender and just wilted, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve.",

    "name": "Fluffy Mashed Potatoes",
    "ingredients": "2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes (4 to 6 medium), peeled, cut into 1-inch chunks, rinsed well, and drained\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\nTable salt\n2/3 cup whole milk, warm\nGround black pepper",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: We wanted a mashed potato recipe that allowed more of the prep work to be done in advance (who wants burnt fingers from peeling hot potatoes?) but still delivered a fully smooth mash with robust, earthy flavor. So in our mashed potato recipe, we peeled and steamed the potatoes rather than boiling them and rinsed them midway through cooking to prevent them from getting gummy and starchy during prolonged exposure to cooking water.\n\n1. Place metal colander or steamer insert in large pot or Dutch oven. Add enough water for it to barely reach bottom of colander. Turn heat to high and bring water to boil. Add potatoes, cover, and reduce heat to medium-high. Cook potatoes 10 minutes. Transfer colander to sink and rinse potatoes under cold water until no longer hot, 1 to 2 minutes. Return colander and potatoes to pot, cover, and continue to cook until potatoes are soft and tip of paring knife inserted into potato meets no resistance, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Pour off water from Dutch oven.\n\n2. Set ricer or food mill over now-empty pot. Working in batches, transfer potatoes to hopper of ricer or food mill and process, removing any potatoes stuck to bottom. Using rubber spatula, stir in melted butter and 1/2 teaspoon salt until incorporated. Stir in warm milk until incorporated. Season to taste with salt and pepper; serve immediately.",

    "description": "We prefer the ease of prewashed baby spinach, sold in 5-ounce packages in most supermarkets. If you choose to use bunched baby spinach instead, make sure to wash and dry the leaves well\n\nFor a wilted spinach salad recipe that would give us a not-too-greasy dressing and spinach with a slight but satisfying crunch, we cut back on the usual 4:1 ratio of oil to acid and added the lemon juice or vinegar once the oil and other ingredients had been heated to maintain brightness. To avoid overly wilted spinach, we used a mere ¼ cup of dressing for 6 cups of greens in our spinach salad recipe.",

Add the chicken and stir until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or for up to 1 hour.\n\nHeat the broiler with a rack about 6 inches from the broiler element. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil, set a wire rack in the baking sheet and mist it with cooking spray. In a blender, puree the cashews with ¾ cup water until smooth, about 1 minute; set aside.\n\nIn a large Dutch oven over medium, melt 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon ginger and the garlic, then cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon garam masala and the remaining 1 tablespoon cumin. Add the cashew puree and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to brown, about 3 minutes.

Reduce to medium and cook, stirring often, until the sauce is thick enough to heavily coat a spoon, 12 to14 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.\n\nArrange the chicken with its marinade still clinging to it in an even layer on the prepared rack. Broil until well browned and lightly charred on both sides, 15 to 20 minutes, flipping the pieces once about halfway through. Transfer to the sauce, bring to a simmer over medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until a skewer inserted into the chicken meets no resistance, about 10 minutes. Off heat, stir in the cilantro and lime juice, then let stand for 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",

    "name": "Hacker-Free Neapolitan Pizza for a Home Kitchen",
    "ingredients": "20 ounces (4 cups) Italian tipo \"00\" flour (see note), plus extra for dusting dough\n.3 ounces (about 2 1/4 teaspoons) kosher salt, plus extra for assembly\n.2 ounces (about 1 teaspoon) active dry yeast\n.2 ounces (about 2 teaspoons) sugar\n12 ounces water\n1 (14-ounce) can whole peeled Italian tomatoes\n12 ounces buffalo mozzarella or fresh cow's milk mozzarella\n6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n24 basil leaves",
    "directions": "Note: you can use Better No-Knead Bread recipe for dough.\n\n1. Combine flour, salt, yeast, and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Whisk to combine. Add water and knead on low speed just until mixture comes together and no dry flour remains. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Knead on low speed for an additional ten minutes. The mixture should come together into a cohesive mass that barely sticks to the bottom of the bowl as it kneads. Depending on the type of flour used, you may need to add up to 1/2 cup additional flour. If dough sticks heavily to bottom of bowl, add flour 1 tablespoon at a time with mixer running until it forms a mass that just barely sticks to the bowl. Cover bowl tightly with plastic or transfer the dough to two gallon-sized zipper lock bags, seal, and refrigerate for at least 8 and up to 72 hours.\n\n2. Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and dust the top with additional flour. Using a bench scraper, divide the dough into six even pieces, approximately six ounces each. Using floured hands, shape each piece into a neat ball by gathering the dough towards the bottom. Coat four small containers with non-stick cooking spray or olive oil (large cereal bowls work great for this) and add one dough ball to each bowl. Lightly spray top of dough ball with non-stick cooking spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap, and allow to rise at room temperature for 2 hours (dough should roughly double in volume).\n\n3. Meanwhile, drain tomatoes in fine meshed strainer and break them up with your fingers, squeezing excess juice out from the interior. Transfer the tomatoes to a blender with a 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and blend until smooth. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Cut the mozzarella into 1/2-inch chunks and place on a plate on a triple layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Place another triple layer of paper towels or clean dish towel on top of the cheese and stack another plate on top. Allow the excess water to blot out for at least 10 minutes.\n\n4. Transfer 1 ball of dough to a medium bowl filled with flour and flip to coat. Lift it and gently pat off the excess flour. Transfer it to a floured surface and gently stretch it into a 10-inch circle, leaving the outer 1-inch edge slightly thicker than the center. The best way to do this it to start by gently stretching with your fingertips. Pick up the slightly stretched dough and place it on the opened face of your left hand. Toss it back and forth between your opened hands, rotating it slightly with each toss until it stretches out to around 8-inches in diameter. Return it to the work surface. With your left hand flat in the center of the round, use your right hand to stretch the edge of the dough out, rotating as needed until it is an even 10-inches in diameter.\n\n5. Have your tomato sauce, drained cheese, pizza dough, olive oil, kosher salt, and basil leaves ready and close to the stovetop. Preheat the broiler to high and arrange the rack such that you can just barely fit a 12-inch heavy-bottomed oven-proof cast iron or stainless steel skillet on top of it. Dust skillet with flour, tap out excess, then heat the skillet over high heat and heat until lightly smoking, about three minutes. Transfer one dough round to the skillet. It should fill up the entire bottom surface. Working quickly, spread two tablespoons sauce evenly over the dough, leaving the outer 1-inch border un-sauced. Top with 1/6 of the cheese chunks. Season with kosher salt. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and scatter four basil leaves over the surface. Transfer skillet to broiler and broil until pizza is puffed and darkly charred in spots (this can take anywhere between 1 1/2 to 4 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler). Return the skillet to the stovetop and cook until the bottom is darkly charred in spots, using a thin metal spatula to peek after about 1 minute (depending on the skillet you use, you may skip this step if the pizza is already charred). Transfer the pizza to a cutting board and serve immediately. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to bake remaining pizzas.",

    "notes": "This recipe is about as close as you can get to wood-burning oven-style Neapolitan pizza without having to void the warranty of your oven. The Antimo Caputo Tipo \"00\" Italian bread flour called for helps improve the texture, but is not necessary. Regular bread flour (of even all-purpose flour) will work just fine.\n\nFor best results, use weight measurements, not volume.",

    "ingredients": "2 tablespoons curry powder (sweet or mild)\n1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala (see note above)\n1/4 cup vegetable oil\n2 medium onions, chopped fine (about 2 cups)\n12 ounces Red Bliss potatoes, scrubbed and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (about 2 cups)\n3 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)\n1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger\n1 - 1 1/2 serrano chiles, ribs, seeds, and flesh minced (see note above)\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n1/2 medium head cauliflower, trimmed, cored, and cut into 1-inch florets (about 4 cups)\n1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, pulsed in food processor until nearly smooth with 1/4-inch pieces visible\n1 1/4 cups water\n1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed\nTable salt\n8 ounces frozen peas (about 1 1/2 cups)\n1/4 cup heavy cream or coconut milk",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Toasting store-bought curry powder in a skillet for our vegetable curry recipe turned it into a flavor powerhouse. Further experimentation proved that a few pinches of garam masala added even more spice flavor. To build the rest of our flavor base, we started with a generous amount of sautéed onion, ghee (or vegetable oil), garlic, ginger, fresh chiles, and tomato paste for sweetness.\n\n1. Toast curry powder and garam masala in small skillet over medium-high heat, stirring constantly, until spices darken slightly and become fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove spices from skillet and set aside.\n\n2. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions are caramelized and potatoes are golden brown on edges, about 10 minutes. (Reduce heat to medium if onions darken too quickly.)\n\n3. Reduce heat to medium. Clear center of pan and add remaining tablespoon oil, garlic, ginger, chile, and tomato paste; cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add toasted spices and cook, stirring constantly, about 1 minute longer. Add cauliflower and cook, stirring constantly, until spices coat florets, about 2 minutes longer.\n\n4. Add tomatoes, water, chickpeas, and 1 teaspoon salt; increase heat to medium-high and bring mixture to boil, scraping bottom of pan with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Cover and reduce heat to medium. Simmer briskly, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in peas and cream or coconut milk; continue to cook until heated through, about 2 minutes longer. Adjust seasoning with salt and serve immediately, passing condiments separately.",

Add the onion, tomatoes and guajillo chilies, then cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is well browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the beans, whole garlic cloves, bay and aniseed, then stir in 10 cups water. Bring to a boil, then cover partially and reduce to low. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are completely tender, 1½ hours to 2 hours.\n\n02 Stir in 1 teaspoon salt. Set a colander in a large bowl and drain the beans, reserving the cooking liquid. Remove and discard the bay leaves from the beans. Transfer the drained beans to a food processor and pulse a few times to break up the beans. With the machine running, add 1½ cups of the reserved cooking liquid and process until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed. Taste and season with salt, then set aside.\n\n03 In a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium, heat 2 tablespoons of the remaining lard until shimmering. Add the minced garlic, cumin, coriander, chili powder and oregano, then cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\n\n04 Stir in the pureed beans and cook, stirring frequently, until beginning to brown on the bottom, 8 to 10 minutes. Continue to cook and stir, adding reserved cooking water as needed, until the mixture has the consistency of mashed potatoes, 5 to 7 minutes. Off heat, stir in the remaining 1 tablespoon lard, then taste and season with salt and pepper.",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "Dont fill the blender by more than two-thirds with hot soup; if necessary, process in three batches. You can also use an immersion blender to process the soup directly in the pot. Use the lowest setting on your toaster to dry out the bread without overbrowning it. A garnish is essential to add texture and flavor to this soup. We like Fried Leeks (recipe follows), crisp bacon bits, a dollop of sour cream, or freshly chopped chives. The soup can also be garnished with Garlic Chips or Garlic Croutons (see related recipes).",

    "directions": "The chickpeas in this recipe must be soaked overnight; you can not substitute canned beans or quick-soaked chickpeas because their texture will result in soggy falafel. Dissolve salt in 2 quarts cold water and add the chickpeas. A wire spider comes in handy here when cooking the falafel. Serve the falafel in lavash or pita bread with lettuce, pickled vegetables, and chopped tomatoes or cucumbers, or as an hors d’oeuvres with the tahini sauce as a dip.\n\n1. For the tahini sauce: Process all of the ingredients in a food processor until smooth, about 20 seconds. Season with salt to taste and set aside. (The sauce can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Bring to room temperature and stir to combine before serving.)\n\n2. For the falafel: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 200 degrees. Drain the chickpeas, discarding the soaking liquid. Process all of the ingredients except for the oil in a food processor until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping down the bowl as needed. Form the mixture into 1 tablespoon-sized disks, about 1/2 inch thick and 1 inch wide, and arrange on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. (The falafel can be refrigerated at this point for up to 2 hours.)\n\n3. Heat the oil in a 5-quart large Dutch over medium-high heat to 375 degrees. (Use an instant-read thermometer that registers high temperatures or clip a candy/deep-fat thermometer onto the side of the pan.) Fry half of the falafel, stirring occasionally and adjusting the heat as needed to maintain 375 degrees, until deep brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined baking sheet using a slotted spoon or wire spider and keep warm in the oven. Return the oil to 375 degrees and repeat with the remaining falafel.

    "name": "Best Prime Rib",
    "ingredients": "1 (7-pound) first-cut beef standing rib roast (3 bones), meat removed from bones, bones reserved\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n2 teaspoons vegetable oil",
    "directions": "1. Using sharp knife, cut slits in surface layer of fat, spaced 1 inch apart, in crosshatch pattern, being careful to cut down to, but not into, meat. Rub 2 tablespoons salt over entire roast and into slits. Place meat back on bones (to save space in refrigerator), transfer to large plate, and refrigerate, uncovered, at least 24 hours and up to 96 hours.\n\n2. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over high heat until just smoking. Sear sides and top of roast (reserving bone) until browned, 6 to 8 minutes total (do not sear side where roast was cut from bone). Place meat back on ribs, so bones fit where they were cut, and let cool for 10 minutes; tie meat to bones with 2 lengths of twine between ribs. Transfer roast, fat side up, to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and season with pepper. Roast until meat registers 110 degrees, 3 to 4 hours.\n\n3. Turn off oven; leave roast in oven, opening door as little as possible, until meat registers about 120 degrees for rare or about 125 degrees for medium-rare, 30 to 75 minutes longer. If the roast has not reached the correct temperature in the time range, heat the oven to 200 degrees, wait for 5 minutes, then shut it off, and continue to cook the roast until it reaches the desired temperature.\n\n4. Remove roast from oven (leave roast on baking sheet), tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for at least 30 minutes and up to 75 minutes.\n\n5. Adjust oven rack about 8 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Remove foil from roast, form into 3-inch ball, and place under ribs to elevate fat cap. Broil until top of roast is well browned and crisp, 2 to 8 minutes.\n\n6. Transfer roast to carving board; cut twine and remove roast from ribs. Slice meat into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Season with coarse salt to taste, and serve.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Look for a roast with an untrimmed fat cap (ideally ½ inch thick). We prefer the flavor and texture of prime-grade beef, but choice grade will work as well. To remove the bones from the roast, use a sharp knife and run it down the length of the bones, following the contours as closely as possible until the meat is separated. Monitoring the roast with a meat-probe thermometer is best. If you use an instant-read thermometer, open the oven door as little as possible and remove the roast from the oven while taking its temperature. If the roast has not reached the correct temperature in the time range specified in step 3, heat the oven to 200 degrees, wait for 5 minutes, then shut it off, and continue to cook the roast until it reaches the desired temperature.\n\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nThe perfect prime rib should have a deep-colored, substantial crust encasing a tender, juicy rosy-pink center. To achieve this perfect roast, we started by salting the roast overnight. The salt enhanced the beefy flavor while dissolving some of the proteins, yielding a buttery-tender roast. To further enhance tenderness, we cooked the roast at a very low temperature, which allowed the meat's enzymes to act as natural tenderizers, breaking down its tough connective tissue. A brief stint under the broiler before serving ensured a crisp, flavorful crust.",

    "name": "Pasta with Spicy Tomato and Pancetta Sauce",
    "ingredients": "14½ ounce can whole peeled tomatoes\n2 tablespoons gochujang OR 1 tablespoon Calabrian chili paste\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil\n4 ounces pancetta, chopped\n4 medium garlic cloves, minced\n4 bay leaves\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n1 sprig rosemary\n1 pound penne, ziti or rigatoni pasta\n½ cup lightly packed fresh basil, torn\nWhole-milk ricotta cheese, to serve",
    "directions": "01 In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. In a blender, puree the tomatoes with juices and gochujang until smooth, 30 to 60 seconds; set aside.\n\n02 While the water heats, in a 12-inch skillet, combine the oil, pancetta, garlic, bay, tomato paste, rosemary and ½ teaspoon pepper. Cook over medium, stirring often, until the pancetta has rendered some of its fat and the tomato paste darkens and begins to stick to the pan, 6 to 8 minutes. Add the pureed tomato mixture and bring to a simmer, scraping up any browned bits. Simmer, uncovered and stirring often, until very thick and the fat separates, about 10 minutes.\n\n03 Meanwhile, when the water reaches a boil, add 1 tablespoon salt and the pasta; cook, stirring occasionally, until just shy of al dente. Reserve about 1½ cups of the cooking water, then drain the pasta and return it to the pot. (If the sauce is done ahead of the pasta, remove the skillet from the heat.)\n\n04 Scrape the sauce into the pot with the pasta and add ¾ cup of the reserved cooking water. Cook over medium, stirring and tossing often, until the sauce clings and the pasta is al dente, 2 to 4 minutes; add more reserved pasta water as needed to loosen the noodles if the mixture is very dry and sticky.\n\n05 Off heat, remove and discard the bay and rosemary. Taste and season with salt and pepper, then stir in the basil. Serve topped with dollops of ricotta.",

    "name": "Bread Stuffing with Fresh Herbs",
    "ingredients": "2 pounds hearty white sandwich bread (20 to 22 slices), cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 16 cups)\n3 pounds turkey wings, divided at joints (see photo) (see note)\n2 teaspoons vegetable oil\n6 tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, plus extra for baking dish\n1 large onion, chopped fine (about 1 1/2 cups)\n3 celery ribs, chopped fine (about 1 1/2 cups)\n2 teaspoons table salt\n2 tablespoons minced fresh thyme leaves\n2 tablespoons minced fresh sage leaves\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 ½ cups low-sodium chicken broth\n3 large eggs\n3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves",
    "directions": "Two pounds of chicken wings can be substituted for the turkey wings. If using chicken wings, separate them into 2 sections (it’s not necessary to separate the tips) and poke each segment 4 or 5 times. Also, increase the amount of broth to 3 cups, reduce the amount of butter to 2 tablespoons, and cook the stuffing for only 60 minutes (the wings should register over 175 degrees at the end of cooking). Use the meat from the cooked wings to make salad or soup.\n\n1. Adjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 250 degrees. Spread bread cubes in even layer on 2 rimmed baking sheets. Bake until edges have dried but centers are slightly moist (cubes should yield to pressure), 45 to 60 minutes, stirring several times during baking. (Bread can be toasted up to 1 day in advance.) Transfer to large bowl and increase oven temperature to 375 degrees.\n\n2. Use tip of paring knife to poke 10 to 15 holes in each wing segment. Heat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Add wings in single layer and cook until golden brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Flip wings and continue to cook until golden brown on second side, 4 to 6 minutes longer. Transfer wings to medium bowl and set aside.\n\n3. Heat butter in skillet over medium heat. When foaming subsides, add onion, celery, and ½ teaspoon salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are softened but not browned, 7 to 9 minutes. Add thyme, sage, and pepper; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1 cup broth and bring to simmer, using wooden spoon to scrape browned bits from bottom of pan. Add vegetable mixture to bowl with dried bread and toss to combine.\n\n4. Grease 13 by 9-inch baking dish with butter. In medium bowl, whisk eggs, remaining 1½ cups broth, remaining 1½ teaspoons salt, and any accumulated juices from wings until combined. Add egg/broth mixture and parsley to bread mixture and gently toss to combine; transfer to greased baking dish. Arrange wings on top of stuffing, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and place baking dish on rimmed baking sheet.\n\n5. Bake on lower-middle rack until thickest part of wings registers 175 degrees on instant-read thermometer, 60 to 75 minutes. Remove foil and transfer wings to dinner plate to reserve for another use. Using fork, gently fluff stuffing. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.\n\nTurkey Wings to the Rescue\n\nBaking stuffing with browned turkey wings on top creates the same rich savoriness of stuffing cooked inside the bird. Here is the basic formula; see the recipes above for instructions on adding meat and fruit.\n\n1. Prep wings\n\nCut through the joint with a sharp chef’s knife. If the turkey wing comes with a tip, cut through this joint as well.\n\n2. Brown Wings\n\nSear the turkey wings to trigger the flavor-producing Maillard reaction. Remove them from the skillet.\n\n3. Sauté Aromatics\n\nCook the chopped onions and celery in rendered fat and butter to develop a savory flavor base.\n\n4. Deglaze with Broth\n\nDeglaze the pan with broth to release the fond and capture every last bit of flavor. Add mixture to dried bread cubes.\n\n5. Top, Cover, Bake\n\nTop the stuffing with the browned wings, cover with aluminum foil to trap moisture, and bake.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines, and chicken adobo is among the most popular. The dish consists of chicken simmered in a mixture of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, bay leaves, and black pepper. The problem with most recipes we found was that they were aggressively tart and salty. Our secret to taming both of these elements was coconut milk. The coconut milk’s richness tempered the bracing acidity of the vinegar and masked the briny soy sauce, bringing the sauce into balance.",

    "description": "Keema matar, from the Indian subcontinent, is often made with ground lamb or mutton and potatoes, but we use ground beef and green peas. The garam masala adds robust spiciness, but not much chili heat. If you'd like the bite of chili in the dish, serve it with hot sauce or minced fresh jalapeños or serranos. Warm naan is the perfect accompaniment to keema, but basmati rice is also good.",

    "directions": "01 In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the honey, peppers, thyme and ½ teaspoon black pepper. Microwave, uncovered, on high until fragrant and warm, about 1 minute; set aside. In a medium bowl, toss the arugula with the lemon juice; set aside.\n\n02 In a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high, combine 2 tablespoons oil and half of the rolls, placing the pieces cut sides down. Cook until golden brown on the bottoms, 2 to 4 minutes, then transfer toasted sides up to a cutting board. Using 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil, toast the remaining bread in the same way.\n\n03 In the same skillet over medium-high, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering. Add the halloumi in a single layer and cook, undisturbed for the first couple minutes then occasionally flipping each slice, until browned on both sides, 4 to 6 minutes total; reduce the heat if the cheese is browning too quickly. Remove the pan from the heat.\n\n04 Brush the toasted sides of the bread with infused honey, dividing it evenly. Lay the peach slices on the bottom halves of rolls, then top with the halloumi, followed by the arugula, evenly dividing the ingredients. Cover with the top halves of the rolls.",

    "ingredients": "1 ½ pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined, tails left on, if desired (see note)\n4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n3 tablespoons ouzo (see note)\n5 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 5 teaspoons)\n1 teaspoon Grated zest from 1 lemon\ntable salt and ground black pepper\n1 small onion, diced medium (about 3/4 cup)\n½ medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced medium (about ½ cup)\n½ medium green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced medium (about ½ cup)\n½ teaspoon red pepper flakes\n1 (28-ounce) can diced tomato, drained, 1/3 cup juices reserved (see note)\n¼ cup dry white wine\n2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh parsley leaves\n6 ounces feta cheese, crumbled (about 1½ cups) (see note)\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill leaves",
    "directions": "1. Toss shrimp, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon ouzo, 1 teaspoon garlic, lemon zest, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon black pepper in small bowl until well combined. Set aside while preparing sauce.\n\n2. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, red and green bell pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt and stir to combine. Cover skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables release their moisture, 3 to 5 minutes. Uncover and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture cooks off and vegetables have softened, about 5 minutes longer. Add remaining 4 teaspoons garlic and red pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and reserved juice, wine, and remaining 2 tablespoons ouzo; increase heat to medium-high and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors have melded and sauce is slightly thickened (sauce should not be completely dry), 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper.\n\n3. Reduce heat to medium-low and add shrimp along with any accumulated liquid to pan; stir to coat and distribute evenly. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are opaque throughout, 6 to 9 minutes for extra-large or 7 to 11 minutes for jumbo, adjusting heat as needed to maintain bare simmer. Remove pan from heat and sprinkle evenly with feta. Drizzle remaining tablespoon oil evenly over top and sprinkle with dill. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "This recipe works equally well with jumbo (16 to 20 per pound) or extra-large (21 to 25 per pound) shrimp, but the cooking times in step 3 will vary slightly depending on which you use. If you don’t have ouzo, see “No Ouzo?” (below) for suggested alternatives. Our preferred brand of canned diced tomatoes is Hunt’s, and our preferred brand of feta cheese is Mt. Vikos Traditional. Serve the shrimp with crusty bread or steamed white rice.",

    "ingredients": "**Dough**\n1 ¼ cups (6 1/4 ounces/177 grams) all-purpose flour\n½ cup (2¾ ounces/78 grams) whole-wheat flour\n1 tablespoon sugar\n¾ teaspoon salt\n10 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch pieces and chilled\n7 tablespoons ice water\n1 teaspoon white vinegar\n\n**Filling**\n1 ¼ pounds shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced thin\n5 teaspoons olive oil\n1 pound leeks, white and light green parts only, sliced ½ inch thick and washed thoroughly (3 cups)\n1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme\n2 tablespoons crème fraîche\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\nSalt and pepper\n3 ounces (85 grams) Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled (3/4 cup)\n1 large egg, lightly beaten\nkosher salt\n2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley",
    "directions": "**FOR THE DOUGH: **Process flours, sugar, and salt in food processor until combined, 2 to 3 pulses. Add butter and pulse until it forms pea-size pieces, about 10 pulses. Transfer mixture to medium bowl.\n\nSprinkle water and vinegar over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix until loose, shaggy mass forms with some dry flour remaining (do not overwork). Transfer mixture to center of large sheet of plastic wrap, press gently into rough 4-inch square, and wrap tightly. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.\n\nTransfer dough to lightly floured work surface. Roll into 11 by 8-inch rectangle with short side of rectangle parallel to edge of work surface. Using bench scraper, bring bottom third of dough up, then fold upper third over it, folding like business letter into 8 by 4-inch rectangle. Turn dough 90 degrees counterclockwise. Roll out dough again into 11 by 8-inch rectangle and fold into thirds again. Turn dough 90 degrees counterclockwise and repeat rolling and folding into thirds. After last fold, fold dough in half to create 4-inch square. Press top of dough gently to seal. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes or up to 2 days.\n\n**FOR THE FILLING:** Cover mushrooms in bowl and microwave until just tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to colander to drain and return to bowl. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add leeks and thyme, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are tender and beginning to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to bowl with mushrooms. Stir in crème fraîche and mustard. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside.\n\n**TO BAKE:** Adjust oven rack to lower middle position, place pizza stone on oven rack, and heat oven to 400 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and let stand at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. Roll out on generously floured (up to ¼ cup) work surface to 14-inch circle about 1/8 inch thick. (Trim edges as needed to form rough circle.) Transfer dough to parchment paper–lined rimmed baking sheet. With tip of paring knife, cut five ¼-inch circles in dough (one at center and four evenly spaced midway from center to edge of dough). Brush top of dough with 1 teaspoon oil.\n\nSpread half of filling evenly over dough, leaving 2-inch border around edge. Sprinkle with half of Gorgonzola, cover with remaining filling, and top with remaining Gorgonzola. Drizzle remaining 1 teaspoon oil over filling. Grasp 1 edge of dough and fold up outer 2 inches over filling. Repeat around circumference of tart, overlapping dough every 2 to 3 inches; gently pinch pleated dough to secure but do not press dough into filling. Brush dough with egg and sprinkle evenly with kosher salt.\n\nLower oven temperature to 375 degrees. Bake until crust is deep golden brown and filling is beginning to brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool tart on baking sheet on wire rack for 10 minutes. Using offset or wide metal spatula, loosen tart from parchment and carefully slide tart off parchment onto cutting board. Sprinkle with parsley, cut into wedges, and serve.",

    "notes": "These crunchy, cheesy breaded chicken breasts are baked, not fried, making for hands-off cooking and easy cleanup. Instead of relying on a typical three-part dredge — with flour, eggs and bread crumbs — this recipe uses mayonnaise to help the bread crumbs adhere to the chicken. The mayonnaise does the job beautifully, adding flavor and moisture in the process. Tossing the panko-Parmesan mixture in olive oil helps the bread crumbs brown in the oven, mimicking the crisp texture of a fried cutlet but with way less oil. Serve with a simple green salad or your favorite sauce for dipping, as these breaded chicken cutlets are essentially large-format, dinner-friendly chicken tenders.",

    "ingredients": "500 gram bread flour (separated into 375/125 gm)\n330 grams water\n200 gram sourdough starter (50/50 mix - testing for right amount, see notes)\n18 gm salt\n1.5 gm yeast (optional)\n\n",
    "directions": "**Autolyse**\n1. Pour all the ingredients, **except 125 gm of flour**, into the mixer. So all of the water, salt, starter, yeast (if used) and **375 gm of the flour** are put into the mixer.  Everything should be room temperature or a bit cooler.\n\n2. Mix on lowest speed for 1-2 minutes or until completely blended. At this stage you should have a mix that is drier  than a batter, but wetter  than a dough. Closer to batter probably.\n\n3. Cover and let it rest for 20 minutes. \n\n**Wet Kneading**\n4. Start Mixing on Low speed for 8 minutes. After 5 minutes, start adding the remaining flour gradually.\n\nThis part is critical and it's something that I did not understand at all until relatively recently: \nEven if the dough is very sticky -- that is it does not have enough flour in it to form a ball and it is still halfway between a batter and a dough -- it is still working. This is where MOST of the kneading occurs. The gluten is working at this point even though it's not a dough yet.\n\nIf you are using a Kitchen Aid, and you lift the hook, the dough should fall off by itself. The hook should look like its going through the dough, and not pushing the dough around.  It should be that wet until nearly the end.\n\n5. After the first 6-8 minutes increase the speed of the mixer slightly. I never go higher than 1/3 of the dial on my mixer. You should add most of the remaining flour. But you still want a very wet dough, so don't go crazy.\n\nThe dough should be getting much firmer and should form more of a ball.  \n\nMix 1 minute or so at this stage  You may find that the dough is sticking to the roller/hook and not really working too much at this point. Once the dough is at this point, it is done. \n\nOne of the best ways to see how your dough is doing is to sprinkle a little flour on in and just feel it. It should feel baby bottom soft. If you don't sprinkle flour it will just feel sticky and not look smooth. But sprinkle a tiny bit of flour and now it's soft and smooth. This is what you want. This is a much gentler recipe than most and it shows in the final dough.\n\n6. Let it rest for 15-20 minutes. Divide and refrigerate for 1-3 days. Let warm for at least 1 hour before use.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "8-Oct-2021: trying 250gm, 1/2 tsp yeast\n\n24-Sep-2021: tried 100 gm starter. Little rise. Will try 200 gm next.\n\nAutolyse is a fancy word that just means one simple thing. The flour and water should sit together for at least 20 minutes before kneading begins.  It's a CRITICAL step. Some say that you should mix just the flour and water together, then after 20 minutes add the salt and yeast, then mix. Others say you can add all the ingredients at the beginning. I have found very little difference.\n\nOne of the most important things I've found is that these rest periods have a huge impact on the final product. I've seen so much arguing online about the proper flour for making pizza. \"You need super high protein flour to get the right structure for a pizza dough\". People argue endlessly about brands and minor changes in flour blends, types of water, etc. A lot of this is myth and a big waste of time. The autolyse period is FAR more important to creating structured gluten development than is the starting protein percentage. Autolyse and knead properly and AP flour will produce a great pizza with a lot of structure. Do these steps poorly and bread or high gluten flour will not help you at ALL. This step reminds me of mixing pie dough. After you add the water to pie dough, it's crumbly. But after sitting for 20 minutes, it's a dough. The water takes time to soak in, and when it does it transforms the pie dough. It's really a similar thing here with pizza dough.\n\nThere is no need to dissolve the yeast in warm water or feed it sugar. 'Proofing' the yeast was probably required decades ago, but I've never had yeast that didn't activate. The yeast feeds on the flour so you don't need to put in sugar. The proofing step that you see in many recipes is really an old wives tale at this point.\n\nMy recommendation is this: DON'T BE A SLAVE TO RECIPES AND PERCENTAGES. It's fine to use the spreadsheet or other measures as a guideline, but you have to judge how much flour goes into the dough by feeling it. Do NOT force more flour into the mix just to reach a number. If the dough feels good and soft and you still have flour you have not put in, don't sweat it. Leave it out. In the end you need a wet dough. In fact, even the dough has formed more of ball, if you let it sit, it should spread out a little and look a little limp. This is what you want, not a tight ball, but a slack, wet soft dough.\n\n",

    "ingredients": "1 ½ pounds sirloin steak tips, trimmed and cut into ½-inch chunks\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into ¼-inch pieces\nKosher salt and pepper\n1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum pan (if using charcoal)\n4 hamburger buns",
    "directions": "This recipe requires freezing the meat twice, for a total of 65 to 80 minutes, before grilling. When stirring the salt and pepper into the ground meat and shaping the patties, take care not to overwork the meat or the burgers will become dense. Sirloin steak tips are also sold as flap meat. Serve the burgers with your favorite toppings or one of our grilled-vegetable toppings (see related content).\n\n1. Place beef chunks and butter on large plate in single layer. Freeze until meat is very firm and starting to harden around edges but still pliable, about 35 minutes.\n\n2. Place one-quarter of meat and one-quarter of butter cubes in food processor and pulse until finely ground into pieces size of rice grains (about 1/32 inch), 15 to 20 pulses, stopping and redistributing meat around bowl as necessary to ensure beef is evenly ground. Transfer meat to baking sheet. Repeat grinding with remaining 3 batches of meat and butter. Spread mixture over sheet and inspect carefully, discarding any long strands of gristle or large chunks of hard meat, fat, or butter.\n\n3. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon pepper and 3/4 teaspoon salt over meat and gently toss with fork to combine. Divide meat into 4 balls. Toss each between hands until uniformly but lightly packed. Gently flatten into patties 3/4 inch thick and about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Using thumb, make 1-inch-wide by 1/4-inch-deep depression in center of each patty. Transfer patties to platter and freeze for 30 to 45 minutes.\n\n4A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Using skewer, poke 12 holes in bottom of disposable pan. Open bottom vent completely and place disposable pan in center of grill. Light large chimney starter filled two-thirds with charcoal briquettes (4 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into disposable pan. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\n4B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.\n\n5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Season 1 side of patties liberally with salt and pepper. Using spatula, flip patties and season other side. Grill patties (directly over coals if using charcoal), without moving them, until browned and meat easily releases from grill, 4 to 7 minutes. Flip burgers and continue to grill until browned on second side and meat registers 125 degrees for medium-rare or 130 degrees for medium, 4 to 7 minutes longer.\n\n6. Transfer burgers to plate and let rest for 5 minutes. While burgers rest, lightly toast buns on grill, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer burgers to buns and serve.\n",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nCreating a juicy and loosely textured burger that could withstand the rigors of grilling called for a number of tactics. First, we ground our own meat in the food processor, which let us choose the cut (steak tips), grind (coarse), and consistency (loose) of the burger when we shaped it. Incorporating a little salt before shaping added richness, boosted juiciness, and seasoned the burgers throughout. Finally we shaped the burgers (with a dimple in their centers to prevent bulging) and froze them for 30 minutes, which held them together as they cooked and let them stay on the grill a few minutes longer for excellent char and perfect rosy centers.",

Let the extracted liquid sit undisturbed for 5 minutes to allow the starch to settle, then pour off the liquid so that only the starch remains.\n\nWhisk the egg into the starch and set aside.\n\nAdd the schmaltz to a cast-iron skillet to measure 1/8 inch deep and heat over medium until shimmering. (Don't let it get over 375ºF; that's its smoke point.)\n\nPlace the potatoes in a large bowl, add the instant mashed potatoes, salt, and pepper, and combine using your hands. Stir in the egg mixture.\n\nDrop a mounded tablespoon's worth of the potato mixture into the skillet and flatten firmly with the back of a spatula. Fry in batches of 4 until browned, flipping only once, 2 to 3 minutes per side, then remove to a rack set over a pan lined with paper towels. Season immediately with additional salt.

    "name": "Nut-Crusted Chicken Cutlets with Lemon and Thyme",
    "ingredients": "4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts(6 to 8 ounces each), trimmed of excess fat (see note)\nKosher salt\n1 cup roughly chopped almonds(see note)\n4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces\n1 medium shallot, minced (about 3 tablespoons)\n1 cup panko(Japanese-style bread crumbs)\n2 teaspoons finely grated zest from 1 lemon, zested lemon cut into 4 wedges\n1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme leaves\n1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n3 large eggs\n2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Adding chopped nuts to a coating is a great way to add robust flavor to otherwise lean and mild boneless, skinless chicken breasts. But nut coatings are often dense and leaden, and the rich flavor of the nuts rarely comes through. Using a combination of chopped almonds and panko bread crumbs—rather than all nuts—kept the coating light and crunchy, and the bread crumbs helped the coating adhere. Instead of frying the breaded chicken breasts, we found that baking them in the oven was not only easier, but also helped the meat stay juicy and ensured an even golden crust. But it wasn’t until we cooked the coating in browned butter prior to breading the chicken that we finally achieved the deep nutty flavor we sought.\n\n1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Using fork, poke thickest half of each breast 5 to 6 times. Place on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and evenly sprinkle each breast with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (or 1/4 teaspoon table salt). Refrigerate, uncovered, while preparing coating.\n\n2. Process nuts in food processor until they resemble coarse meal, about 20 one-second pulses. Heat butter in 12-inch skillet over medium heat; cook, swirling pan constantly, until butter turns golden brown and has nutty aroma, 4 to 5 minutes. Add shallot and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (or 1/4 teaspoon table salt); cook, stirring constantly, until just beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, add panko and ground nuts; cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer panko mixture to shallow dish or pie plate and stir in lemon zest, thyme, and cayenne.\n\n3. Lightly beat eggs, mustard and black pepper together in second shallow dish or pie plate. Place flour in third shallow dish or pie plate. Pat chicken dry with paper towels. Working with 1 piece at a time, dredge chicken breast in flour, shaking off excess, then coat with egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Coat all sides of chicken with panko mixture, pressing gently so that crumbs adhere. Transfer breaded chicken to clean wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and repeat with remaining chicken.\n\n4. Bake until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of chicken registers 160 degrees, 20 to 25 minutes. Let rest 5 minutes before serving with lemon wedges.",

    "description": "Some tastes take longer to acquire than others. Even those who have accustomed their palates to the robust flavors of whiskey and gin are left breathless by initial encounters with bitter Italian liqueurs. Campari is typically the first amari encountered, with its searing crispness lighting up drinks such as Negronis and Americanos. But even those who have accustomed themselves to Campari's sharp bitterness are often thrown for a loop when first sampling Fernet Branca.\n\nDeveloped in the mid-19th century as a digestivo, Fernet Branca is Baroquely bitter with a complex aroma and flavor rich with cardamom, gentian and peppermint. While it has a devoted fan base--San Francisco seems to live on the stuff--Fernet Branca has such an assertive flavor that it has no doubt frightened away plenty of novice drinkers.\n\nHere's a cocktail that helps the Fernet Branca-curious start off gently. Pairing the Italian bitter with the crispness of rye whiskey and softening the blow with sugar, the Toronto Cocktail keeps the Fernet from dominating the show. In the same flavor realm as the Boulevardier, the Toronto is a richly flavored, mildly bitter cocktail that also pairs perfectly with a crisp autumn evening.",

    "ingredients": "8 large eggs\n4 scallions, sliced thin\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon minced fresh sage\nSalt and pepper\n2 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled (1/2 cup)\n3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thin\n2 garlic cloves, sliced thin\n3 cups water\n6 ounces angel hair pasta, broken in half",
    "directions": "Headnote\n\nTo ensure the proper texture, it’s important to use angel hair pasta for this recipe. We like to serve the frittata warm or at room temperature, with a side salad.\n\nDescription Text\n\n1. Whisk eggs, scallions, olive oil, sage, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in large bowl until egg is even yellow color. Stir in Gorgonzola and set aside.\n\n2. Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and 1/8 teaspoon salt, cover, and cook until mushrooms release liquid, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook until liquid evaporates and mushrooms turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Stir in garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat. Transfer mushrooms to bowl with egg mixture and wipe out skillet.\n\n3. Bring water, pasta, remaining 7 teaspoons vegetable oil, and 3/4 teaspoon salt to boil in now-empty skillet over high heat, stirring occasionally. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, water has evaporated, and pasta starts to sizzle in oil, 8 to 12 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook pasta, swirling pan and scraping under edge of pasta with rubber spatula frequently (do not stir), until bottom turns golden and starts to crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.\n\n4. Using spatula, push some pasta up sides of skillet so entire pan surface is covered with pasta. Pour egg mixture over pasta. Using tongs, lift up loose strands of pasta to allow egg to flow toward pan, being careful not to pull up crispy bottom crust. Cover skillet and continue to cook over medium heat until bottom crust turns golden brown and top of frittata is just set (egg below very top will still be raw), 5 to 8 minutes. Slide frittata onto large plate. Invert frittata onto second large plate and slide it browned side up back into skillet. Tuck edges of frittata into skillet with rubber spatula. Continue to cook second side of frittata until light brown, 2 to 4 minutes longer.\n\n5. Remove skillet from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Using your hand or pan lid, invert frittata onto cutting board. Cut into wedges and serve.\n\nUSE A SKILLET: Add water, broken angel hair, and oil to skillet—the only vessel you will need for this dish.\n\nCOOK OFF LIQUID: Once pasta is tender, keep cooking until water evaporates and pasta starts sizzling in oil.\n\nLET IT CRISP: After about 5 minutes, pasta will start to crisp (check progress by lifting up the edge).\n\nLIFT LOOSE STRANDS: Pour eggs over pasta, then gently pull up top strands to allow eggs to flow into center.\n\nSLIDE AND INVERT: To brown second side, slide frittata onto plate, invert onto second plate, and return to skillet.",

    "ingredients": "1  whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 1/2 pounds), giblets removed and discarded (see note)\n1 tablespoon kosher salt or 1 1/2 teaspoons table salt\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper",
    "directions": "1. Place chicken breast-side down on work surface. Following photos above, use tip of sharp knife to make four 1-inch incisions along back of chicken. Using fingers or handle of wooden spoon, carefully separate skin from thighs and breast. Using metal skewer, poke 15 to 20 holes in fat deposits on top of breast halves and thighs. Tuck wing tips underneath chicken.\n\n2. Combine salt, baking powder, and pepper in small bowl. Pat chicken dry with paper towels and sprinkle all over with salt mixture. Rub in mixture with hands, coating entire surface evenly. Set chicken, breast-side up, in V-rack set on rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, for 12 to 24 hours.\n\n3. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Using paring knife, poke 20 holes about 1 1/2 inches apart in 16- by 12-inch piece of foil. Place foil loosely in large roasting pan. Flip chicken so breast side faces down, and set V-rack in roasting pan on top of foil. Roast chicken 25 minutes.\n\n4. Remove roasting pan from oven. Using 2 large wads of paper towels, rotate chicken breast-side up. Continue to roast until instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part of breast registers 135 degrees, 15 to 25 minutes.\n\n5. Increase oven temperature to 500 degrees. Continue to roast until skin is golden brown, crisp, and instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part of breast registers 160 degrees and 175 degrees in thickest part of thigh, 10 to 20 minutes.\n\n6. Transfer chicken to cutting board and let rest, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Carve and serve immediately.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: We wanted a juicy roasted chicken recipe with skin that would crackle with every bite. A simple set of steps got us there: We first cut an incision down the chicken’s back to allow fat to escape and then loosened the skin from the thighs and breasts, poking holes in the fat deposits to allow multiple channels for excess fat and juices to escape; then, since skin can’t brown until all the surface moisture evaporates, we added baking powder to our salt rub to dehydrate the skin and air-dried the chicken overnight. Finally, we roasted the chicken at high heat to speed browning.",

The salad is best eaten the day it is made, but it can be refrigerated for up to four hours in advance; hold off on adding the feta and olives until just before serving.\n\nDon't massage the lemon and salt into the cabbage and carrots.

    "name": "Cast Iron Pan Pizza",
    "ingredients": "GATHER YOUR INGREDIENTS\nDough\n2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour\n1 teaspoon table salt\n1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast\n1 cup (8 ounces) warm water (105 to 110 degrees)\nVegetable oil spray\nSauce\n1 (14.5-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes\n1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil\n1 garlic clove, minced\n¼ teaspoon sugar\n¼ teaspoon table salt\n¼ teaspoon dried oregano\nPinch red pepper flakes\nPizza\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (1 cup)\n7 ounces whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (1¾ cups)",
    "directions": "FOR THE DOUGH: Using wooden spoon or spatula, stir flour, salt, and yeast together in bowl. Add warm water and mix until most of flour is moistened. Using your hands, knead dough in bowl until dough forms sticky ball, about 1 minute. Spray 9-inch pie plate or cake pan with oil spray. Transfer dough to prepared plate and press into 7- to 8-inch disk. Spray top of dough with oil spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.\n\nFOR THE SAUCE: Place tomatoes in fine-mesh strainer and crush with your hands. Drain well, then transfer to food processor. Add oil, garlic, sugar, salt, oregano, and pepper flakes and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)\n\nFOR THE PIZZA: Two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n\nCoat bottom of 12-inch cast-iron skillet with oil. Transfer dough to prepared skillet and use your fingertips to flatten dough until it is ⅛ inch from edge of skillet. Cover tightly with plastic and let rest until slightly puffy, about 1½ hours.\n\nThirty minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 550°. Spread ½ cup sauce evenly over top of dough, leaving ½-inch border (save remaining sauce for another use). Sprinkle Monterey Jack evenly over border. Press Monterey Jack into side of skillet, forming ½- to ¾-inch-tall wall. (Not all cheese will stick to side of skillet.) Evenly sprinkle mozzarella over sauce. Bake until cheese at edge of skillet is well browned, 12-15 minutes.\n\nTransfer skillet to stovetop and let sit until sizzling stops, about 3 minutes. Run butter knife around rim of skillet to loosen pizza. Using thin metal spatula, gently lift edge of pizza and peek at underside to assess browning. Cook pizza over medium heat until bottom crust is well browned, 2 to 5 minutes (skillet handle will be hot). Using 2 spatulas, transfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Slice and serve.",

    "ingredients": "Chipotle Sofrito Sauce\n2 Chipotle in Adobo (2 peppers plus 3 tbsp adobo sauce liquid)\n2 tbsp Olive Oil\n2 Cup Water (or low-sodium vegetable stock, 1/4 cup and rest divided)\n1 tbsp Cumin Powder (toasted)\n2 tsp Oregano (preferrably dried mexican oregano)\n1 tsp Salt (adjust per taste)\n3 tbsp Lemon (juice of about 2 medium lemons)\n1 tbsp Sugar\n1 Poblano Pepper (roasted on open flame, seeds and skin removed)\n2 tbsp Tomato Paste\n2 Garlic (cloves)\nTofu\n1.25 lbs Tofu (super firm tofu. two 10 ounce packets, will need half the sauce/marinade)\n2 tbsp Canola Oil (for shallow frying)",
    "directions": "1. Start with roasting the pepper. It took me 5 minutes to beautifully char this poblano! Let cool a little, then remove seeds and scrap-off skin of poblano. Set aside.\n\n2. For sauce, in a blender/food processor jar, add chipotle pepper, adobo sauce, poblano pepper, garlic, cumin powder, oregano and tomato paste.\n\n3. Add olive oil, salt, lemon juice, sugar, and 1/4 cup water/vegetable stock. Process to make a fine puree. Set aside.\n\n4. To prepare Tofu - Pat dry tofu with paper towel to soak any moisture. Heat 1 tbsp oil in a non-stick pan, add half of tofu and shallow fry until crisp from both sides. (about 3-4 minutes each side). Repeat with remaining tofu.\n\n5. Drain prepared tofu on paper towel to soak excess of oil while you finish frying rest.\n\n6. Make Sofritas - In a wide pan, add 1/2 cup of sofritas marinade/sauce prepared in step 3. Saute stirring frequently until oil starts to show on side. (just 2-3 minutes) This ensures raw garlic taste is gone and also flavor develops with cooking sauce.\n\n7. Add fried and chopped tofu and cook for 1 minutes coating in the sauce.\n\n8. Add remaining stock (if using) or water. Mix well and bring mixture to rolling boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 6-8 minutes. Break pieces of tofu with spatula once-in-a-while while sauce is cooking. Don't let water/stock completely dry-off, leave sauce little sauce-y like chipotle's.",

    "name": "This Creamy King Ranch Casserole Recipe Has a \"Texas-Size Fan Club\"",
    "ingredients": "For the Poached Chicken:\n1 1/2 tablespoons cumin seeds\n3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (10 ounces; 283g)\n6 cups (1.5L) unsalted chicken broth, homemade or store-bought, at room temperature\n2 small jalapeño chiles (1 ounce; 28g), halved and unseeded\n1 tablespoon (9g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume\nFor the Casserole:\n18 (about 5 1/2-inch) corn tortillas (see notes)\nNonstick cooking spray\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 1/2 ounces; 42g)\n1 large yellow onion (10 ounces; 284g), chopped\n2 large red bell peppers (about 5 3/4 ounces; 166g each), chopped\n1 large poblano pepper (3 1/2 ounces; 100g), seeded and chopped\n3 medium cloves garlic (15g), finely chopped\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour (about 1 ounce; 30g)\n1 tablespoon chili powder\n2 1/2 teaspoons granulated chicken bouillon, such as Maggi\nOne 10-ounce can diced tomatoes and green chiles, such as Rotel, drained\n1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream\n1 cup chopped fresh cilantro (1 ounce; 28g), plus more for garnish\n1/3 cup sour cream (about 2 3/4 ounces; 76g)\n1 1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume\n2 1/2 cups Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (10 ounces; 280g), divided",
    "directions": "For the Poached Chicken: In a medium pot set over medium heat, toast cumin seeds, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add chicken, chicken broth, chiles, and salt. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until broth is just shy of a simmer and the temperature registers between 150º and 160ºF (65 to 70ºC) on an instant-read thermometer, about 12 minutes. (See notes.)\n\nReduce heat to low to maintain the temperature of the broth. (To help maintain the temperature, increase or reduce the heat as needed, and/or re-position the pot over stovetop burner so that the heat source only partially touches bottom of the pot.) Cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers 150°F (65ºC), 30 to 35 minutes. Carefully transfer chicken to a large bowl, and let rest until chicken is cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Using 2 forks, shred chicken; set aside. Using a fine-mesh strainer set over a large bowl, strain broth; discard solids. Set aside 2 1/2 cups (592ml) broth. Reserve remaining broth for another use.\n\nWhile chicken cooks, prepare the casserole: Adjust oven racks to top third and lower third positions and preheat oven to 400ºF (205ºC). Arrange tortillas on 2 large rimmed baking sheets (they will be slightly overlapping). Lightly spray both sides with cooking spray. (Alternatively, use pastry brush to lightly brush tortillas with a thin layer of neutral oil.)\n\nBake until slightly crisp and browned in spots, about 14 minutes, flipping tortillas halfway through and rotating baking sheets between top and bottom racks. Remove from oven and let cool until ready to use. (Tortillas will continue to crisp as they cool.)\n\nIn a large pot or Dutch oven set over medium-high, melt butter. Add onion, bell pepper, poblano, and garlic; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 8 minutes. Add flour, chili powder, and granulated chicken bouillon. Cook, stirring often, until fragrant and flour just begins to stick to bottom of the pot, about 1 minute. Add diced tomatoes and green chiles, cream, and 2 1/2 cups reserved broth; bring to a simmer over medium-high. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in cilantro, sour cream, salt, and shredded chicken until thoroughly combined.\n\nTo assemble, place 6 tortillas in the bottom of a 9- by 13-inch baking dish. Spoon 3 cups of the chicken mixture over tortillas, and top with 1/2 cup of Monterey Jack cheese. Repeat with second layer. Top with remaining 6 tortillas, remaining 2 cups chicken mixture, and remaining 1 1/2 cups cheese.\n\nBake, uncovered, at 400°F on top third rack of oven until bubbling and browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Garnish with additional cilantro.",

    "directions": "**01** In a small bowl, stir together the onion, lemon juice and 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Set aside. Fill a large saucepan with about 1 inch of water. Place a folding steamer basket in the pan, cover and bring to a boil over medium-high.\n\n**02** Meanwhile, fill a medium bowl with ice water. Add the eggs to the steamer basket, cover and cook for 9 minutes. Immediately transfer the eggs to the ice water and let stand until cooled. Crack and peel the eggs, then cut each one lengthwise into 4 wedges.\n\n**03** While the eggs cook, in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high, heat 2 tablespoons of oil until shimmering. Add the potatoes in an even layer and cook, stirring once halfway through, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Reduce to medium and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until a knife inserted into the largest pieces meets no resistance, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.\n\n**04** Using a potato masher or fork, roughly mash the potatoes with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 2 teaspoons of sumac, 1 teaspoon kosher salt and ½ teaspoon pepper; the mixture should remain quite chunky. Stir in the chopped mint. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n**05** Spoon the potato mixture onto the bread, dividing it evenly. Place the egg wedges on top, then scatter over the torn mint and the pickled red onion. Sprinkle with additional kosher salt or flaky salt, if using, and the remaining 1 teaspoon sumac, then drizzle with additional oil.",

    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 500 degrees. Spray rimmed baking sheet liberally with vegetable oil spray. Cut thin slice from 2 opposing long sides of each potato; discard slices. Cut potatoes lengthwise into 1/2-inch-thick slices and transfer to large bowl.\n\nCombine 2 teaspoons cornstarch, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper in small bowl. Sprinkle cornstarch mixture over potatoes and toss until potatoes are thoroughly coated and cornstarch is no longer visible. Add oil and toss to coat.\n\nArrange potatoes in single layer on prepared sheet and bake until golden brown on top, about 16-18 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, process Parmesan, rosemary, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and remaining 2 teaspoons cornstarch in food processor until cheese is finely ground, about 1 minute.\n\nRemove potatoes from oven. Sprinkle Parmesan mixture evenly over and between potatoes (cheese should cover surface of baking sheet), pressing on potatoes with back of spoon to adhere. Using two forks, flip slices over into same spot on sheet.\n\nBake until cheese between potatoes turns light golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer sheet to wire rack and let potatoes cool for 15 minutes. Using large metal spatula, transfer potatoes, cheese side up, and accompanying cheese to platter and serve.",
    "description": "To make this recipe work, we had to figure out two things: how to cook the potatoes just right and how to get the cheese to stick to the potatoes. Roasting the cornstarch-dusted and seasoned potato slices on a greased baking sheet in a very hot 500-degree oven until nearly done creates a creamy interior. Then we liberally sprinkle cheese over and between the slices and press the cheese onto the slices. To ensure that we get an even layer of crispy cheese, we flip the slices over (in the same footprint) and continue to bake until the cheese turns a light golden brown. It may look strange, but once the potatoes and cheese have cooled, the potatoes come off the baking sheet easily and are covered in a crispy cheese “skirt.”",

    "name": "Grill-Roasted Prime Rib For Charcoal Grill",
    "ingredients": "1 first-cut (3- or 4-rib) beef standing rib roast, meat removed from bones, bones reserved, exterior fat trimmed to 1/8 inch (see note above)\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\nGround black pepper\n1/4 cup kosher salt\nKitchen twine for tying roast, cut into four or six 2 1/2-foot lengths, (depending on number of bones)\n2 wood chunks (3-inch)\n1 Large disposable aluminum baking pan",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: We wanted a great crust from our prime rib recipe, without the mess and without setting off the smoke detectors, so we moved the proceedings outside. First, we seared the fat-covered side (to minimize flare-ups, we had the butcher trim the fat layer down to a thin 1/8 inch), then we moved the roast to the cooler side of the grill. To get crispiness from our prime rib recipe, we applied a dry salt rub to the roast three hours before grilling. This drew out moisture from just below the surface, allowing for faster evaporation once we began searing.\n\n1. Rub roast with oil and season generously with pepper. Spread salt on rimmed baking sheet; press roast into salt to coat evenly on all sides. Tie meat back onto bones exactly from where it was cut, passing two lengths of twine between each set of bones and knotting securely. Refrigerate roast, uncovered, for 1 hour, then let stand at room temperature 2 additional hours.\n\n2. Meanwhile, soak wood chunks in water for 1 hour; drain. About 20 minutes before grilling, open top and bottom grill vents. Using chimney starter, ignite 4 quarts charcoal briquettes (about 60 coals) and burn until partially covered in thin, gray ash, about 15 minutes. Empty coals into grill; build modified two-level fire by arranging coals to cover one-half of grill. Place disposable roasting pan on empty side of grill. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush.\n\n3. Place roast on grate over hot side of grill and sear on fat-covered sides until well browned, turning as needed, 8 to 10 minutes total. (If flare-ups occur, move roast to cooler side of grill until flames die down.) When thoroughly browned, transfer roast to cooler side of grill, bone side down, with tips of bones pointed away from fire. Place soaked wood chunks on coals. Cover grill, positioning top vent over roast to draw smoke through grill. Grill-roast (do not remove lid for at least 1 1/2 hours) until instant-read thermometer inserted into center of roast reads 125 degrees for medium-rare, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.\n\n4. Transfer roast to cutting board and let rest 20 minutes, lightly tented with foil. Remove strings and bones, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices, and serve.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nWhite gazpacho is a chilled Spanish soup of almonds, bread, and garlic. It predates the more familiar tomato-based version and has a creamy sophisticated flavor that belies its short ingredient list. To achieve the best texture, we begin by grinding the almonds in a blender before incorporating the bread and garlic. Then we emulsify the olive oil into the base for our soup and finally thin it down with water to get the correct consistency. Our white gazpacho’s flavor is enhanced with a tiny addition of almond extract. This pop of sweet, floral notes balances the assertiveness of the olive oil and garlic. We further emphasize these notes with garnishes of toasted almonds and sliced green grapes.",

    "description": "**Velvety Beef, Without Velveting**\n\nThe ultratender texture of the stir-fried beef served in Chinese restaurants comes from a classic technique known as velveting, which involves coating the meat and blanching it in a pot of oil before stir-frying even takes place. We looked for a more streamlined way to protect and tenderize the meat.",
    "notes": "**Stir-Fry Fundamentals**\n\nNo matter what you’re stir-frying, follow these guidelines to ensure success.\n\nBe ready for quick cooking: Prep ingredients in advance.\n\nFor even browning, use a nonstick skillet, not a wok.\n\nLimit stirring so meat and vegetables can develop color.\n\nSear in batches so meat doesn’t steam.\n\nAdd aromatics last to preserve flavor and avoid scorching.",

Take meat directly from refrigerator, remove foil, and place on cake rack set in shallow roasting pan. Roast exactly 30 minutes.\n\nRemove meat from oven; immediately reduce oven temperature to 325 degrees. Insert instant-read meat thermometer at one end of roast, going into thickest part of the center (temperature will range from 80 to 110 degrees); let roast rest at room temperature, uncovered, for exactly 30 minutes. (At this point roast’s internal temperature will range from 115 to 140 degrees.) After this 30-minute rest, remove meat thermometer, return meat to oven, and roast until meat thermometer inserted in thickest part of roast reaches an internal temperature of 145 degrees, 15 to 30 minutes longer, depending on roast’s internal temperature at end of resting period. Since roast may cook unevenly, take temperature readings from a couple of locations, each time plunging thermometer to center of meat and waiting 15 seconds.\n\nLet roast stand at room temperature, uncovered, for 15 to 20 minutes to finish cooking. (The temperature should register between 150 and 155 degrees.) Slice meat thin and serve.\n\n",

    "ingredients": "2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, plus more for garnish\n1/2 teaspoon grated lemon zest (from 1 lemon), plus more for garnish\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 pound (460g) thin asparagus, ends trimmed and cut diagonally into 3-inch pieces (about 3 cups); see notes\n2 ounces (58g) soft fresh goat cheese, crumbled (1/2 cup)\nOne 8.6-ounce (.245g) sheet puff pastry, thawed if frozen (from one 17.3-ounce package.)\nAll purpose flour, for dusting\n1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon (15ml) tap water\nFlaky sea salt\nCracked black pepper",
    "directions": "Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C); position oven rack in lower third of oven. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Trace a 8 1/2- by 8 1/2–inch square on paper using a nontoxic permanent marker or pencil; if using marker, let ink dry slightly before flipping paper over so ink is facing towards baking sheet. Brush oil evenly within traced square. Sprinkle thyme, lemon zest, and salt evenly over oil.\n\nArrange asparagus pieces in chevron pattern within traced square: Beginning on left side of traced square, arrange asparagus pieces in a row at a 45-degree angle pointing from the lower left to the upper right; trim asparagus as needed to fit row's entire length. Next, make a second row alongside the first, but with the asparagus pieces angled 45 degrees from upper left to lower right. Repeat pattern as needed to fill entire square, using any leftover small pieces to fill gaps Alternatively, arrange asparagus as desired. Sprinkle all over with goat cheese; set aside.\n\nRoll puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 9 1/2–inch square. Carefully lay pastry over asparagus design so that it overhangs asparagus by 1/2 inch on all sides. Press along edges of pastry to seal against the baking sheet, then press on pastry all over to adhere to cheese and asparagus underneath. Lightly score pastry with paring knife, making about 8 cuts in a diagonal pattern. Brush with egg wash.\n\nBake in lower third of oven until pastry is puffed and deep golden brown, about 18 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack and let cool 5 minutes. Place a cutting board over pastry, carefully invert tart onto cutting board, then remove and discard parchment. Garnish with flaky sea salt, black pepper, and additional lemon zest and thyme. Slice into nine 3-inch squares; serve warm or at room temperature.\n\nAsparagus can be cut and stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Tart is best assembled and baked day-of.",

    "ingredients": "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces and chilled, divided\n1 onion, chopped fine\n5 garlic cloves, minced\n4 teaspoons grated fresh ginger\n1 serrano chile, stemmed, seeded, and minced\n1 tablespoon garam masala\n1 teaspoon ground coriander\n½ teaspoon ground cumin\n½ teaspoon pepper\n1 ½ cups water\n½ cup tomato paste\n1 tablespoon sugar\n2 teaspoons table salt, divided\n1 cup heavy cream\n2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed\n½ cup plain Greek yogurt\n3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, divided",
    "directions": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nTraditionally, butter chicken is mildly spiced. If you prefer a spicier dish, reserve, mince, and add the ribs and seeds from the chile. Serve with basmati rice and/or warm naan.\n\nMelt 2 tablespoons butter in large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, ginger, and serrano and cook, stirring frequently, until mixture is softened and onion begins to brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garam masala, coriander, cumin, and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add water and tomato paste and whisk until no lumps of tomato paste remain. Add sugar and 1 teaspoon salt and bring to boil. Off heat, stir in cream. Using immersion blender or blender, process until smooth, 30 to 60 seconds. Return sauce to simmer over medium heat and whisk in remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Remove saucepan from heat and cover to keep warm. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 4 days; gently reheat sauce before adding hot chicken.)\n\nAdjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Combine chicken, yogurt, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt in bowl and toss well to coat. Using tongs, transfer chicken to wire rack set in aluminum foil—lined rimmed baking sheet. Broil until chicken is evenly charred on both sides and registers 175 degrees, 16 to 20 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through broiling.\n\nLet chicken rest for 5 minutes.

Add chicken bouillon powder, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, dried oregano, and sugar. Grind until chiles are finely ground. (Alternatively a mortar and pestle may be used to grind the mixture.) Set aside in a small heatproof bowl.\n\nIn a zip-top bag, combine chicken wings and pickled chile brine. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 8 hours.\n\nSet a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet; set aside. In a large bowl, whisk flour and masa harina to combine. In a medium bowl, add buttermilk. Remove wings from pickle brine, shake excess liquid back into the bag, transfer wings to buttermilk, and toss to coat.\n\nWorking with 1 wing at a time, transfer to flour mixture, turning to thoroughly coat in flour and pressing to adhere, then shake off excess flour mixture and transfer dredged wings to prepared wire rack. Let wings rest on wire rack at room temperature for at least 15 or up to 30 minutes.\n\nWhen ready to fry, set a separate wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet and line with paper towels. Add oil to large Dutch oven or stock pot. Heat over medium-high heat until oil reaches 150℉ (65℃), then carefully transfer 3/4 cup of hot frying oil to spice mix blend in bowl. Whisk to combine; set aside.\n\nContinue to heat oil until it reaches 350℉ (175℃). Fry 1/3 of the wings, adjusting temperature as needed to maintain oil around 350℉ (175℃), until chicken is crispy, deep golden brown, and registers 175℉ (80°C) on an instant-read thermometer, 6 to 9 minutes. Using a spider skimmer or slotted spoon, transfer to prepared rack. Repeat with the remaining 2 batches of wings, keeping cooked chicken warm in a 200℉ (95°C) oven while frying remaining wings.\n\nAdd fried wings to a large bowl. Whisk chili oil to recombine and pour over the wings. Gently toss until wings are thoroughly coated. Serve.",

Taste and season with salt and black pepper and, if desired, stir in additional chili-bean sauce. Serve sprinkled with the scallion greens and cilantro sprigs. Offer chili oil for drizzling to taste.",
    "description": "Toban djan, a fermented paste made with salted chilies and beans and sometimes other seasonings, supplies deep savoriness and loads of umami. Look for it in jars in the international aisle of supermarkets or in Asian grocery stores. If you can’t find it, ¼ cup red miso mixed with 3 tablespoons chili-garlic sauce is a decent substitute. If you’ll be shopping at an Asian market, also look for black cardamom pods. With smoky notes and hints of menthol, the spice has a flavor that’s markedly different from more widely available green cardamom and white cardamom, so do not substitute with these varieties. If black cardamom is not an option, simply omit it—the stew will still be delicious. Serve with steamed rice or, Dunlop says, even mashed potatoes.",

Bake for 4 minutes (the bacon will begin to shrink slightly but you won't see much visual change other than that). Remove baking sheet from oven and turn oven to broil. Flip shrimp and brush again with honey mixture. Return to oven and broil until bacon is crisped on edges, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip shrimp again and brush with remaining honey mixture. Broil until bacon is crisped on edges, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nCarefully remove wooden picks, transfer shrimp to a serving plate, and garnish with chopped chives (if using).

    "directions": "1. Combine 3 tablespoons salt, 4 quarts water, and beans in large Dutch oven and bring to boil over high heat. Remove pot from heat, cover, and let stand 1 hour. Drain and rinse well.\n\n2. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Place ancho chiles in 12-inch skillet set over medium-high heat; toast, stirring frequently, until flesh is fragrant, 4 to 6 minutes, reducing heat if chiles begin to smoke. Transfer to bowl of food processor and cool. Do not wash out skillet.\n\n3. Add árbol chiles, cornmeal, oregano, cumin, cocoa, and ½ teaspoon salt to food processor with toasted ancho chiles; process until finely ground, about 2 minutes. With processor running, very slowly add ½ cup broth until smooth paste forms, about 45 seconds, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary. Transfer paste to small bowl. Place onions in now-empty processor bowl and pulse until roughly chopped, about four 1-second pulses. Add jalapeños and pulse until consistency of chunky salsa, about four 1-second pulses, scraping down bowl as necessary.\n\n4. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add onion mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture has evaporated and vegetables are softened, 7 to 9 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chili paste, tomatoes, and molasses; stir until chili paste is thoroughly combined. Add remaining 2 cups broth and drained beans; bring to boil, then reduce heat to simmer.\n\n5. Meanwhile, heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Pat beef dry with paper towels and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Add half of beef and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer meat to Dutch oven. Add ½ bottle lager to skillet, scraping bottom of pan to loosen any browned bits, and bring to simmer. Transfer lager to Dutch oven. Repeat with remaining tablespoon oil, steak, and lager. Once last addition of lager has been added to Dutch oven, stir to combine and return mixture to simmer.\n\n6. Cover pot and transfer to oven. Cook until meat and beans are fully tender, 1½ to 2 hours. Let chili stand, uncovered, 10 minutes. Stir well and season to taste with salt before serving.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Blade steak was easy to cut into pieces and cooked up tender, so it served as the base of our chili recipe. We avoided the grittiness of supermarket chili powders by making our own. Adding cornmeal to our chili powder thickened the chili. For secret ingredients, our chili recipe relies on lager, unsweetened cocoa, and molasses.",

When ready to cook, set sous vide cooker to desired temperature according to chart above.\n\n4. Add bag to sous vide bath and cook for recommended time according to chart above. Make sure to top water up occasionally as it evaporates, and keep bag completely submerged. If bag floats, weigh it down by placing a wet kitchen towel on top of it. Alternatively, use a heavy-duty binder clip to attach a metal spoon or knife to bottom of bag as a weight.\n\n5. When meat is cooked, remove from water bath and transfer contents of bag to a large bowl. Pick out chunks of meat with a set of tongs and transfer them to a rimmed baking sheet. (Discard aromatics and excess liquid, or reserve liquid and blend it in with your salsa.) When it is cool enough to handle, shred meat roughly using 2 forks or your fingers. Spread evenly over baking sheet. Pork can be prepared up to this point and refrigerated in a sealed container for up to 5 days before serving.\n\n6. When ready to serve, adjust an oven rack to 3 inches below the broiler element and preheat broiler to high. Place pork under broiler and cook, using a spoon to flip pieces occasionally, until meat is browned and crisp on most sides, about 10 minutes total. Alternatively, working in batches, heat carnitas in a cast iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp, about 10 minutes.\n\n7.

Bake on lower rack until bottoms of slices are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer sheet to upper rack and heat broiler. (Leave sheet in oven while broiler heats.)

    "description": "We started our easy French toast recipe by whisking together eggs, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and vanilla and then stirring in melted butter and milk. Instead of dipping the bread in the custard mixture one slice at a time, we poured the custard into a rimmed baking sheet that we'd generously sprayed with vegetable oil spray. We placed all the bread slices in the sheet and then flipped each slice. Each side of the bread soaked up just enough egg mixture to give it a creamy, custardy center, but not so much that it cooked up flat and soggy. We baked the slices on the lowest oven rack to brown their bottoms and then turned on the broiler to brown and crisp their tops.",

    "name": "Malaysian-Style Grilled Lemon Grass Chicken (Ayam Percik)",
    "ingredients": "2 guajillo chilies, stemmed, seeded and torn into pieces\nBoiling water, for soaking the chilies\n2 medium shallots, peeled and roughly chopped\n6 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled\n2 inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped\n2 stalks lemon grass, trimmed to the lower 6 inches, dry outer leaves discarded, roughly chopped\n2 teaspoons ground turmeric\nKosher salt and ground white pepper\n1 13½ to 15½ ounce can coconut cream\n3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs and/or drumsticks, trimmed and patted dry\n1 tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oil\n2 tablespoons packed brown sugar\n2 tablespoons lime juice, plus lime wedges to serve",
    "directions": "01 Place the chilies in a small bowl and add boiling water to cover. Let stand until the chilies soften, 15 to 20 minutes, then drain. In a blender, combine the chilies, shallots, garlic, ginger, lemon grass, turmeric, 1 teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon white pepper and 1 cup of the coconut cream. Process until smooth, about 1 minute. Measure 1 cup of the paste into a large bowl and add the chicken. Rub the paste into the pieces; set aside at room temperature while you make the sauce and prepare the grill.\n\n02 In a medium saucepan over medium, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the remaining paste and cook, stirring, until thickened and a silicone spatula drawn through the mixture leaves a trail, about 4 minutes. Stir in the remaining coconut cream and the sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly thickened, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the lime juice. Taste and season with salt and white pepper; cover and set aside.\n\n03 Prepare a charcoal or gas grill. For a charcoal grill, ignite a large chimney of coals, let burn until lightly ashed over, then distribute evenly over one side of the grill bed; open the bottom grill vents. For a gas grill, turn all burners to high. Heat the grill, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes, then clean and oil the grate. If using gas, turn off one burner, leaving the remaining burner(s) on high.\n\n04 Place the chicken skin side up on the cooler side of the grill. Cover and cook until the thickest parts of the pieces (not touching the bone) reach 165°F to 170°F, 30 to 35 minutes. Using tongs, move the chicken, still skin side up, to the hot side of the grill. Cook, uncovered, until nicely charred on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the chicken skin side down and cook until the skin is crisped and nicely charred, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer skin side up to a platter and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n05 Meanwhile, bring the sauce to a simmer, uncovered, over medium, stirring occasionally. Spoon some of the sauce over the chicken and serve the remaining sauce, along with lime wedges, on the side.\n\n06 Oven Version: Follow the recipe to make the paste, season the chicken and prepare the sauce. Heat the oven to 375°F with a rack in the upper-middle position. While the oven heats, set a wire rack in a broiler-safe rimmed baking sheet. Place the seasoned chicken, skin side up, on the rack. Roast until the thickest part of the thighs reaches 175°F, about 35 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn the oven to broil. When the broiler comes up to temperature, return the chicken to the oven and cook until the skin is browned and charred in spots, another 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken skin side up to a platter; let rest 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the sauce to a simmer, uncovered, over medium, stirring occasionally. Spoon some of the sauce over the chicken and serve the remaining sauce, along with lime wedges, on the side.",

    "ingredients": "8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter, cut into 16 pieces, plus more for the pan\n12 ounces bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped\n4 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, finely chopped\n1 large navel orange\n161 grams (¾ cup) plus 71 grams (⅓ cup) white sugar\n½ cup bourbon\n3 tablespoons black peppercorns\n2 tablespoons Angostura bitters\n6 large eggs, beaten\nWhole-milk Greek yogurt, to serve",
    "directions": "Heat the oven to 275°F with a rack in the middle position. Coat the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan with butter. Line the bottom of the pan with kitchen parchment, then butter the parchment. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. In a large bowl, combine the bittersweet and semi-sweet chocolates and the butter; set a fine mesh strainer across the bowl, then set aside.\n\nUsing a vegetable peeler, remove just the outer zest of the orange, not the white pith just beneath, in long strips; set the strips aside. Halve the orange and juice into a liquid measuring cup. Measure 3 tablespoons of the juice into a medium saucepan. Add the bourbon to the remaining juice in the measuring cup, then add enough water to equal 1 cup total liquid; set aside.\n\nAdd the 160 grams (¾ cup) sugar to the juice in the saucepan, then add the zest strips and peppercorns. Set over medium-high and cook, without stirring but occasionally swirling the pan, until the sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes. Continue cooking, swirling the pan often, until the sugar caramelizes to deep mahogany brown and the peppercorns begin to pop, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and carefully pour in the orange juice–bourbon mixture; the caramel will bubble up and harden. Set the pan over medium, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until the caramel has dissolved and the peppercorns no longer stick together, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the bitters.\n\nImmediately pour the hot sugar syrup through the strainer into the chocolate-butter mixture; reserve the strained solids. Jostle the bowl to ensure the chocolate and butter are fully covered with syrup, then let stand for 2 to 3 minutes. Using a silicone spatula, gently stir until the mixture is well combined and completely smooth; it should be barely warm.\n\nAdd the beaten eggs to the chocolate mixture and stir with the spatula until homogenous and glossy, 2 to 3 minutes. Pour into the prepared springform pan. Gently tap the sides of the pan to remove any air bubbles, then use the back of a spoon to smooth the surface. Set the pan on the prepared baking sheet and bake until the cake barely jiggles when the pan is gently shaken, about 45 minutes.\n\nRemove from the oven and immediately run a thin, sharp knife around the edges to loosen the sides of the cake from the pan. Cool to room temperature in the pan, then refrigerate uncovered for at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.\n\nWhile the cake cools transfer the zest strips from the strainer to a small, shallow bowl, removing and discarding any peppercorns stuck to them. Sprinkle the strips with the 70 grams (⅓ cup) sugar, then toss until the strips are completely coated. Cover loosely and store at room temperature until ready to serve.\n\nAbout 2 hours before serving, remove the cake from the refrigerator. Remove the zest strips from the sugar and shake off excess sugar; reserve the sugar for another use. Cut the strips lengthwise into thin strips. Remove the sides of the springform pan. Arrange the zest slivers on the cake around the edges. Slice the cake and serve with small spoonfuls of yogurt.",

    "ingredients": "1/2 pound dried chickpeas (1 generous cup; 225g)\n2 ounces picked fresh cilantro, parsley, or mint leaves, or preferably a mixture of all three (about 2 cups; 55g)\n6 scallions, white and pale green parts only, sliced (about 2 ounces; 55g)\n2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons; 10ml)\n1 teaspoon (about 4g) ground cumin\n1/2 teaspoon (about 2g) ground coriander seeds\n2 teaspoons (about 10g) kosher salt, plus more for seasoning\n2 to 3 cups (480 to 720ml) vegetable oil, for frying\nTahini sauce, hummus, and/or zhug (Yemenite hot sauce) for serving",
    "directions": "Rinse chickpeas and place in a large bowl. Cover with cold water, adding enough to allow the chickpeas to at least triple in volume. Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight. The next day, drain, rinse, and carefully dry chickpeas in a salad spinner.\n\nCombine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until chickpeas are very finely minced, stopping the food processor to scrape down the sides as necessary. A handful of the mixture squeezed into a ball should be able to barely hold together. If not, process a little more.\n\nTransfer mixture to a bowl, cover, and place in refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow time for more starch to seep out of chickpeas. This will help the balls retain their shape better once formed. Using a tablespoon measure, scoop out heaping spoonfuls of the mixture into your hand. Gently shape each into a ball (you will not be able to roll the mixture like cookie dough; this is okay) and place them on a clean plate.\n\nWhen all the balls have been formed, fill a deep cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet or Dutch oven with 3/4 inch of oil. Heat over high heat until oil registers 375°F (190°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Carefully lower chickpea balls into oil one at a time, allowing a little space between each ball and cooking in batches if necessary. Adjust heat as necessary to maintain a temperature of between 350 and 375°F (175 and 190°C). Allow to cook undisturbed until well browned on bottom sides, then carefully flip balls with a fork until browned on second side, about 4 minutes total. Transfer cooked chickpea balls to a paper towel–lined plate and season with salt. Repeat with remaining chickpea balls.\n\nServe immediately with tahini and/or hummus on the side, or stuffed into pita bread with tahini, tomatoes, cucumber, pickles, and shredded cabbage.",

    "name": "Tarragon Chicken Paillards",
    "ingredients": "4 chicken breasts (each 6 to 8 ounces) \n1 medium garlic cloves minced \n1/2 teaspoons coarse salt \n1/2 teaspoons black pepper \n1/2 teaspoons hot red pepper flakes \n2 tablespoons Dijon mustard \n3 tablespoons fresh tarragon chopped \n3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice \n1 tablespoons balsamic vinegar \n1 cups extra-virgin olive oil \n1 cups grape cherry tomatoes halved \n6-8 cups mesclun rinsed and spun dry \n4 fresh tarragon for garnish \n4 lemon wedges for serving \n",
    "directions": "Trim any sinews or excess fat off the breasts and discard. Rinse the breasts under cold running water, then drain (don’t blot dry; the breasts should be damp). Place each breast between two sheets of plastic wrap. Pound it out into a broad flat sheet 1/4 to 1/8-inch thick, using a scallopini pounder or the side of a heavy cleaver. Repeat with the remaining breasts. Place the breasts on a rimmed nonstick baking sheet.\n\nPlace the garlic, salt, black pepper, and hot red pepper flakes in the bottom of a large nonreactive mixing bowl and mash to a paste with the back of a wooden spoon. Add the mustard, 1 tablespoon of the chopped tarragon, and the lemon juice and vinegar, and whisk to mix. Gradually whisk in the olive oil; the mixture will thicken. Pour a quarter of this vinaigrette over the chicken breasts, patting it onto the chicken with a fork. Turn the breasts over, pour another quarter of the vinaigrette on top, and pat it onto the chicken with a fork. Let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator, covered, for 30 minutes. Set the remaining vinaigrette aside. You’ll use it to dress the salad.\n\nJust before you set up the grill, place the tomatoes, mesclun, and the remaining chopped tarragon, in that order, in the bowl with the remaining dressing, but don’t toss them together.\n\nSet up the grill for direct grilling and preheat to high. If using a gas grill, place all of the wood chips or chunks, if desired, in the smoker box or in a smoker pouch and run the grill on high until you see smoke. If using a charcoal grill, preheat it to high, then toss all of the wood chips or chunks, if desired, on the coals.\n\nWhen ready to cook, brush and oil the grill grate. Arrange the paillards on the hot grate, placing them on a diagonal to the bars. Grill the paillards until cooked through, about 2 minutes per side, rotating each a quarter turn after 1 minute to create an attractive crosshatch of grill marks, if desired (use a long, wide spatula to turn over the paillards). To test for doneness, poke a paillard with your finger; it should feel firm to the touch.\n\nTransfer the grilled paillards to a platter or plates. Quickly toss the salad and mound it on top of the paillards. Garnish with the tarragon sprigs and serve at once with the lemon wedges.\n\n",

Pour off the hot water, and shake the eggs in the pan to crack the shells. Add some ice to the pan, and fill it with cold water. Set aside until the eggs are cool enough to handle, and then shell them. Return the eggs to the cool water, and set aside to cool completely.\n\nHeat the olive oil in a skillet. When hot, add the spinach, still wet from washing, and press it into the skillet. Cook until the spinach is soft and wilted, about 3 minutes. Drain spinach. Add the butter to empty skillet and brown. Add back drained spinach, sauté for about a minute. Season with salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Arrange evenly in a gratin dish.\n\nFor the sauce, melt the butter in a small saucepan. Add the flour, and mix it in with a whisk. Add the milk, bring to a boil, stirring (especially in the corners, where the mixture tends to stick and burn), until it comes to the boil. Stir in the salt and pepper, and continue to boil for about 10 seconds. Pour the sauce over the eggs, coating them with the cheese.\n\nPlace the gratine dish about 6 inches from heat under a hot broiler for about 5 minutes, until the surface is nicely browned. If the gratine is assembled ahead and cooled, first place it in a 425-degree oven for about 7 to 8 minutes, then slide it under the broiler for about 5 minutes to heat the eggs and brown the top.",

    "directions": "**1 For the Velvet Chicken:**\nPlace the chicken in a medium bowl, cover with cold water, and vigorously agitate it. Drain through a fine-mesh strainer set in the sink and press on the chicken with your hands to remove excess water. Return the chicken to the bowl and add the salt, wine, baking soda, egg white, and cornstarch. Stir vigorously with your fingertips or chopsticks for 30 seconds. Let marinate in the fridge for at least 15 minutes and up to 8 hours. \n\n**2​ Meanwhile, Make the Sauce:** Combine the pickled chiles, wine, sugar, soy sauce, and vinegar in a small bowl and stir together until homogenous. Set aside. Combine the cornstarch and water in a separate small bowl and stir with a fork until the cornstarch is dissolved. \n\n**3​ To Velvet the Chicken:** Bring 1 quart (1 liter) water to a boil in a wok over high heat. Add the chicken, dropping it in a piece at a time to prevent sticking. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the water returns to a brief simmer and the chicken is mostly cooked through, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer the chicken to a rimmed baking sheet using a spider and spread it into a single layer to dry. Set aside. Dump out the contents of the wok and wipe clean.\n\n4. Get your bowls ready:\na. Carrots, chiles, and bamboo shoots\nb. Ginger, garlic, and scallions \nc. Broad bean chile paste \nd. Velveted chicken on its baking sheet \ne. Sauce \nf. Cornstarch slurry \ng. Serving platter\n\n5​ For the Stir-Fry: Heat the wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of the oil and swirl to coat. Add the carrots, chiles, and bamboo shoots and cook, stirring and tossing constantly until the vegetables are tender-crisp, about 1 minute. Transfer to the baking sheet with the velveted chicken. \n6 ​Wipe out the wok and return to high heat until lightly smoking. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon (15 ml) oil and swirl to coat. Add the ginger, garlic, and scallions and stir-fry until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add the broad bean chili paste and cook, stirring constantly, until the oil breaks out and turns deep red, about 30 seconds. Return the chicken and vegetables to the wok and toss to coat thoroughly in the red oil. \n7​ Stir the sauce and add to the wok by pouring it around the edges. Stir the cornstarch slurry and add a splash. Cook, tossing, until the sauce thickens and the chicken is cooked through, about 30 seconds longer. Adjust the sauce consistency with more cornstarch slurry if it is too thin or a splash of water if it is too thick. Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately with steamed rice.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Adjust the heat level in this dish by adjusting the number of pickled chiles you add. You can also make this dish with fresh chiles by replacing the pickled chile liquid with 1 tablespoon (15 ml) distilled white or rice vinegar along with one to six minced fresh red Thai bird chiles. The recipe as written is quite hot! You can adjust the heat by reducing (or even eliminating) the amount of pickled chiles, replacing them with an equal quantity of white or rice vinegar. You can use an inexpensive balsamic vinegar in place of the Chinkiang. Cowhorn or long green chiles are thin green chiles with moderate spice available at most Asian grocers. You can use Anaheim, poblano, or even jalapeño in their place. For milder heat, use a green bell pepper. Bamboo shoots can be found whole in the refrigerated section of a good Asian supermarket or canned whole or slivered in the international section of most well-stocked Western supermarkets.",

    "directions": "To achieve the smooth glossiness of sports stadium nacho cheese, stand immersion blender in finished cheese sauce and tilt saucepan so sauce covers blade. Blend sauce until shiny, about 30 seconds. This sauce is best served warm. If you have a slow cooker, you can hold it in there on the warm setting. If not, serve the sauce in a microwave-safe bowl so that you can easily reheat it in the microwave as needed (15 to 30 seconds on high power will do the trick).\n\n1. Combine cheddar, Gruyère, and Swiss in medium bowl. Whisk ⅔ cup water and sodium citrate together in small saucepan until sodium citrate dissolves. Bring to simmer over medium heat. Whisking constantly, gradually add cheese mixture, about ¼ cup at a time, to simmering water, making sure each addition is fully incorporated before adding next, about 2 minutes. (Mixture will be very thick.)\n\n2. Reduce heat to medium-low and, whisking constantly, gradually add remaining ⅔ cup water. Scrape down saucepan with rubber spatula and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is slightly thickened, about 45 seconds longer. (Sauce will continue to thicken as it cools.) Remove saucepan from heat and either transfer sauce to serving bowl or make it extra-shiny with an immersion blender. Serve warm, with plenty of tortilla chips. (The sauce can be refrigerated separately in an airtight container for up to 1 week.)",

    "name": "Pork Chops with Apples and Onions",
    "ingredients": "6 bone in pork chops (loin or shoulder),\ncut ¾ inch thick\nCoarse salt and freshly ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\nor vegetable oil\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1 large white onion, sliced\n2 to 3 apples, cored and sliced (about 3 cups)\n1 cup beer, white wine, cider, or chicken broth",
    "directions": "1 Trim the chops of excess fat. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Heat a 14-inch cast-iron skillet (if you have a smaller one, you'll need to work in batches) over high heat, and then swirl in the olive oil. Lay in the pork chops and don't move them for a few minutes, to assure a good golden sear forms. Turn and brown well on the second side for a total of about 10 minutes. Remove the chops to a warm plate.\n2 Swirl the butter into the pan. Add the onion and apples. Sauté until the onion slices are lightly caramelized and the apples have begun to soften, about 8 minutes. Stir in the beer or other liquid. Return the chops to the pan.\n3 Cook until the pork is tender, about 15 more minutes (depending on the size of the chops), turning halfway through and covering the chops with the apple mixture. If the apple mixture needs a little thickening, remove the chops to the warm plate again and simmer the mixture on high for a few minutes to reduce. Serve the chops over rice or mashed potatoes with a large spoonful of the apple-onion mixture over the top. ",
    "description": "This simple dish was one of the first my eldest son requested the recipe for when he got his own kitchen. It's easy to vary: Sometimes we replace the onions with leeks or add a sliced potato, and we have deglazed the pan with beer, white wine, chicken broth, or water. Soft sweet apples and savory onions combine with the salty pork for a tastiness that never disappoints. A big pot of rice, a couple of vegetables, and you have a generous and filling dinner.",
    "notes": "Variations include replacing the onion with leeks or adding a sliced potato. You can deglaze the pan with beer, white wine, cider, chicken broth, or even water. ",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For our flavorful All-American Potato Salad recipe, we decided to use firm-textured Yukon Gold potatoes because they hold their shape after cooking and won’t turn mushy in the salad. Our recipe benefited from the sweetness of an unexpected ingredient: pickle juice. We drizzled the still-warm potatoes with a mixture of pickle juice and mustard. The hot potatoes easily absorbed the acidic liquid and tasted seasoned through to the middle.",

Add the chard and, using tongs, stir it with the onion and raisin mixture (you will need to add the chard in batchesit quickly loses volume as it wilts). Sprinkle the salt and pepper over the chard and, stirring occasionally, cook until the leaves are completely wilted and the stems are easily pierced with a knife, 5 to 6 minutes.

    "notes": "While the stems of mature chard must be excised prior to cooking (and saved for soup or baking in a gratin), tender young chard stems can be included in the sauté, adding a bit of chewiness. To remove thick stems, see the illustration below. Spinach (well dried) and beet greens may be cooked in the same manner with delicious results. Depending on the age of the greens, cooking times may vary by a minute or two. Walnuts are a passable substitution for pine nuts. However, they must be toasted a ­couple of minutes longer than pine nuts.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For our slow-cooker curried chicken recipe, we chose bone-in thighs and breasts, removing the skin to avoid a greasy sauce. We found that store-bought yellow curry powder worked nicely. To balance and round out the flavors, we added a small amount of garam masala—a mixture of “warm” spices that includes coriander, black pepper cumin, cardamom, and cinnamon. Quartering red potatoes for our slow-cooker chicken curry recipe ensured that they would be cooked through when the chicken was done; the cut potatoes absorbed the flavors of the stew and helped to thicken the curry with their starch.",

Pour in the warm broth mixture and whisk constantly until the sauce boils.  Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes.  Remove from the heat.\n\nPour half the hot sauce into the blender with the chiles and spinach.  Cover loosely (I remove the center part of the lid, secure the lid, then drape a cloth over the whole thing) and blend until smooth.  Pour the mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining sauce.  Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons.\n\nFinish the enchiladas.  Heat the oven to 350 degrees.  Smear about 1/4 cup of the sauce over the bottom of each of four to six 9-inch individual ovenproof baking/serving dishes or smear about 1 cup of the sauce over the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish.  Stir 1 cup of the sauce into the chicken.\n\nLay half of the tortillas out on a baking sheet and lightly brush or spray both sides of the tortillas with oil; top each tortilla with another one and brush or spray those with oil.  Bake just to warm through and soften, about 3 minutes.  Stack the tortillas and cover with a towel to keep warm.\n\nWorking quickly so that the tortillas stay hot and pliable, roll a portion of the chicken up in each tortilla, then line them all up in the baking dish(es).  Douse evenly with the remaining sauce and sprinkle with the cheese.  Bake until the enchiladas are hot through (the cheese will have begun to brown), about 20 minutes.  Garnish with the cilantro and serve without hesitation.\n\n",

    "name": "Skillet Beef Top Loin Roast with Potatoes",
    "ingredients": "1 (3-pound) boneless top loin roast\n4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided\n1 teaspoon pepper, divided\n3 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n2 ½ cups beef broth\n3 sprigs fresh thyme\n1 small sprig fresh rosemary\n1 tablespoon unflavored gelatin\n2 garlic cloves, lightly crushed and peeled",
    "directions": "Pat roast dry with paper towels. Place roast fat cap side down and trim off strip of meat that is loosely attached to thicker side of roast. Rotate roast 180 degrees and trim off strip of meat and fat from narrow side of roast. (After trimming, roast should be rectangular with roughly even thickness.) Cut trimmings into 1-inch pieces. Transfer trimmings to small bowl, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate.\n\nUsing sharp knife, cut slits ½ inch apart and ¼ inch deep in crosshatch pattern in fat cap of roast. Sprinkle all sides of roast evenly with 1 tablespoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for 6 to 24 hours.\n\nAdjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Trim and discard ¼ inch from end of each potato. Cut each potato in half crosswise. Toss potatoes with remaining 1 teaspoon salt and remaining ½ teaspoon pepper and set aside.\n\nPlace oil in 12-inch ovensafe skillet. Place roast, fat cap side down, in center of skillet and scatter trimmings around roast. Cook over medium heat, stirring trimmings frequently but not moving roast, until fat cap is well browned, 6 to 10 minutes. Flip roast and continue to cook, stirring trimmings frequently, until bottom of roast is lightly browned and trimmings are rendered and crisp, 3 to 6 minutes longer. Remove skillet from heat and transfer roast to plate. Using slotted spoon, transfer trimmings to small saucepan, leaving fat in skillet.\n\nArrange potatoes in single layer, broad side down, in skillet. Return skillet to medium heat and cook, without moving potatoes, until well browned around edges, 5 to 8 minutes. (Do not flip potatoes.) Off heat, lay 12-inch square of aluminum foil over potatoes. Using oven mitts, crimp edges of foil to rim of skillet. With paring knife, poke 5 holes in center of foil. Lay roast, fat side up, in center of foil. Transfer skillet to oven and cook until meat registers 115 degrees, 45 to 55 minutes.\n\nWhile roast cooks, add broth, thyme sprigs, rosemary sprig, gelatin, and garlic to saucepan with trimmings. Bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes. Strain liquid through fine-mesh strainer into 2-cup liquid measuring cup, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids. (You should have 2 cups liquid; if necessary, add water to equal 2 cups.)\n\nWhen meat registers 115 degrees, remove skillet from oven and increase oven temperature to 500 degrees. Transfer roast to carving board. Remove foil and use to tent roast. Using offset spatula, carefully flip potatoes. Pour strained liquid around potatoes and return skillet (handle will be hot) to oven (it's OK if oven has not yet reached 500 degrees). Cook until liquid is reduced by half, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nCarefully transfer potatoes to serving platter. Pour liquid into fat separator and let settle for 5 minutes. Slice roast and transfer to platter with potatoes. Transfer defatted juices to small bowl. Serve, passing juices separately.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nTop loin roast is also known as strip roast. Use potatoes that are about 1½ inches in diameter and at least 4 inches long. The browned surfaces of the potatoes are very delicate; take care when flipping the potatoes in step 7. To make flipping easier, flip two potatoes and remove them from the skillet to create space before flipping the rest.",

    "ingredients": "**For the Sausage Balls:**\n1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (675 ounces; 190g)\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n2 teaspoons (5g) buttermilk powder\n8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded (see notes)\n8 ounces ground pork breakfast sausage (see notes)\n2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter, melted\n\n**For the Dijonnaise Sauce:**\n1/4 cup (50ml) mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon (15ml) Dijon mustard\n2 teaspoons (10ml) honey",
    "directions": "For the Sausage Balls: Remove ground sausage from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before preparing.\n\nAdjust oven racks to upper-middle and lower-middle positions. Preheat oven to 375℉ (190℃) and line two baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, pepper, and buttermilk powder until combined. Add the shredded cheese and toss until cheese is coated with flour mixture.\n\nAdd sausage and melted butter to the cheese and flour mixture and, using your hands, knead until the mixture comes together evenly and there are no pockets of flour remaining, about 5 minutes.\n\nWorking with one ball at a time, pinch off heaping 1 tablespoon size portion and roll into walnut-size ball. Place shaped sausage balls on prepared baking sheets, divided evenly and spaced evenly apart. You should have about 30 prepared sausage balls total. Bake both sheet pans at the same time, rotating trays halfway through baking, until sausage balls are browned on the bottom and starting to turn golden on the top, and cooked through about 20 minutes.\n\nRemove from the oven and transfer sausage balls to a paper towel-lined plate.\n\nFor the Dijonnaise Sauce: Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk to combine Dijon mustard, mayonnaise, and honey.\n\nTransfer sausage balls to a serving platter and serve with prepared Dijonnaise sauce.\n\nLeftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days.",

    "directions": "Heat the oven to 350°F with racks in the upper- and lower-middle positions. Line 2 baking sheets with kitchen parchment. Measure out 2½ ounces (½ cup) of the chopped chocolate and set aside.\n\nIn a medium sauce pan over high, bring 1 inch of water to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer. In a medium bowl, combine the remaining 5½ ounces chopped chocolate, the butter, cocoa and espresso powder. Set the bowl on the saucepan over the simmering water (the bottom of bowl should not touch the water) and let the mixture melt until completely smooth, stirring often with a silicone spatula. Set aside to cool slightly; keep the saucepan and water over the heat.\n\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the egg whites, sugar, vanilla and salt. Set the bowl on the saucepan over the simmering water and, while whisking constantly, heat the mixture to 100°F. Attach the bowl to the mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and whip on medium-high until the mixture holds soft peaks when the whisk is lifted, 3 to 4 minutes.\n\nUsing a silicone spatula, fold ⅓ of the egg white mixture into the chocolate mixture until almost completely combined. Add the remaining egg whites and fold until a few streaks of white remain. Add the reserved chopped chocolate and fold gently until no white streaks remain.\n\nDrop the batter in 2-tablespoon mounds spaced 1½ inches apart on the prepared sheets. Bake until the tops have cracked but the interiors still looks moist, 12 to 14 minutes, switching and rotating the sheets halfway through. Cool on the baking sheets for 10 minutes, then transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Tip: Don’t omit the step of heating the egg whites and sugar over the saucepan of simmering water. This ensures the sugar fully dissolves so the cookies bake up with shiny, crisp exteriors. But also make sure you don't overheat the mixture (100°F is the ideal temperature), which can cause the whites to cook. Also, the melted chocolate mixture should still be warm when you fold in the whipped egg whites. If it has cooled and thickened, it will be impossible to fold in the whites without deflating them. If needed, before folding in the whites, return the bowl of chocolate to the saucepan and re-melt the mixture.",

Season the chicken with 1 teaspoon each salt, pepper and dried oregano and a pinch of crushed red pepper.\n\nPlace a large Dutch oven or other heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat and add oil. Let oil heat up for a few minutes. Add thighs to the pot, skin side down, and let cook undisturbed until they self-release from the bottom of the pot, about 5 minutes.

Remove from the pot and set aside.\n\nAdd the olives, garlic, shallot and 1 teaspoon each salt, pepper and dried oregano to the pot. Cook over medium-low heat, scraping browned bits from the bottom of the pan, until garlic is fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat up to high, add the rice and broth to the pot, stir to combine and cover until it comes to a boil, about 5 minutes.\n\nRemove the pot from heat, add the browned chicken thighs on top of the rice, skin side up, then cover the chicken thighs with the lemon slices. Place the pot, covered, into the oven and bake until the rice and chicken are fully cooked, 25 to 30 minutes. Serve topped with fresh parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice.",
    "description": "This simple one-pot chicken and rice dish is topped with caramelized lemon slices that add sweet flavor and texture. Thin slices of lemon are cooked in chicken fat and oil until their pulp dissolves, their pith sweetens and their rind softens to the point of being edible. Briny Castelvetrano olives and herby dried oregano are wrapped up in creamy rice and topped with juicy chicken thighs. Fresh parsley and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice on top before serving add brightness and crunch. \n",

    "directions": "01 In a medium bowl, whisk together the miso, soy sauce, chili-garlic sauce, sugar, sesame oil, ginger and garlic until the sugar dissolves. Measure 2 teaspoons of the mixture into a small bowl and set aside. Add the steak to the remaining mixture, turn to coat and let marinate at room temperature for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, to the reserved 2 teaspoons, add the vinegar and 3 teaspoons of the oil. Stir to combine and set aside. Remove the steak from the bowl and pat dry with paper towels.\n\n02 In a heavy-bottomed 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat the remaining 2 teaspoons grapeseed oil until beginning to smoke. Add half of the steak in a single layer and cook without disturbing until well browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip the pieces and cook until the second sides are well browned and the center of the thickest piece reaches 125°F for medium-rare or 130°F for medium, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a platter, then repeat with the remaining steak, using the fat in the pan. Tent with foil and let rest for 10 minutes.\n\n03 Stir any accumulated juices on the platter into the reserved miso mixture. Cut the steak against the grain on the bias into thin slices and return to the platter. Serve with the miso sauce and sliced scallions",
    "description": "For this recipe, we preferred red miso for its deep, rich, savory flavor. It is used in both the marinade and the sauce for the steak. When slicing the steak for serving, be sure to cut against the grain. This results in shorter muscle fibers, which translates to more tender meat. Serve over steamed rice and, if you like, sprinkle with sesame seeds and sliced scallions.\n\nDon’t force the pieces of steak to release from the skillet; when they're nicely seared and ready to be flipped, they will release easily from the pan.\n",

The mixture will quickly become thick and custard-like. Combine soy sauce, water, and Worcestershire sauce and add to gravy gradually. Blend well after each addition, and do not add liquid so rapidly that gravy is very thin. If gravy does become thin from the addition of too much liquid, continued cooking will thicken it.\n\nSet gravy aside, and reheat before serving, or hold over very low heat while preparing the rest of the Grit Golden Bowl.

    "ingredients": "1 pound pork tenderloin, trimmed\n1 ½ teaspoons grated lime zest\n2 tablespoons lime juice\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n2 teaspoons honey\n1 teaspoon fish sauce\n½ teaspoon salt\n¼ teaspoon pepper\n¼ cup vegetable oil\n2 teaspoons mayonnaise\n2 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro\nFlake sea salt (optional)",
    "directions": "1. Slice tenderloin in half crosswise to create 2 steaks total. Pound each half to 3/4-inch thickness. Using sharp knife, cut 1/8-inch-deep slits spaced 1/2 inch apart in crosshatch pattern on both sides of steaks.\n\n2. Whisk lime zest and juice, garlic, honey, fish sauce, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle oil into lime mixture until smooth and slightly thickened. Transfer 1/4 cup lime mixture to small bowl and whisk in mayonnaise; set aside sauce. Add steaks to bowl with remaining marinade and toss thoroughly to coat; transfer steaks and marinade to large zipper-lock bag, press out as much air as possible, and seal bag. Let steaks sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.\n\n3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\n3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).\n\n4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Remove steaks from marinade (do not pat dry) and place over hotter part of grill. Cook, uncovered, until well browned on first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip steaks and cook until well browned on second side, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer steaks to cooler part of grill, with wider end of each steak facing hotter part of grill. Cover and cook until meat registers 140 degrees, 3 to 8 minutes longer (remove steaks as they come to temperature). Transfer steaks to carving board and let rest for 5 minutes.\n\n5. While steaks rest, microwave reserved sauce until warm, 15 to 30 seconds; stir in cilantro. Slice steaks against grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drizzle with half of sauce; sprinkle with sea salt, if using; and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.",
    "description": "Thin pork medallions are tricky to cook well on the grill. We ditched the traditional shape in favor of pork tenderloin “steaks” by cutting one tenderloin in half and pounding each steak to 3/4 inch thick. This simple step increased their surface area for a better ratio of browned exterior to tender interior. We also cut thin slashes in the steaks to promote better penetration of a garlic-citrus marinade that includes honey for better browning and fish sauce for meatiness. Finally we left excess marinade on the steaks to help keep their exteriors from drying out on the grill and then thickened some reserved marinade with mayonnaise for a bold finishing sauce.",
    "notes": "Since marinating is a key step in this recipe, we don’t recommend using enhanced pork.",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "Tip: Don't forget to thaw the peas before use. They are added off heat, when cooking is complete, so if they are still frozen, they will cool the curry. Also, don't be shy about stirring the potatoes as they cook uncovered; stirring helps release potato starch that thickens the curry.",

    "name": "Pad Thai with Shrimp",
    "ingredients": "10 ounces ¼-inch-wide rice noodle sticks\n2 tablespoons tamarind pulp\n1/3 cup boiling water\n2 1/2 tablespoons packed light brown sugar or grated palm sugar\n2 tablespoons oyster sauce\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce\n1 cup bean sprouts\n1 cup lightly packed fresh chives or slender scallions, cut into 1-inch lengths\n1/2 cup roasted peanuts, chopped\n4 tablespoons grapeseed or safflower oil (see headnote), divided\n12 ounces medium (41/50 per pound) shrimp, peeled (tails removed) and deveined\n1 medium shallot, halved and thinly sliced\n3 medium garlic cloves, minced\n1/2-3/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n2 large eggs, beaten\nLime wedges, to serve\nFresh chilies in vinegar, to serve",
    "directions": "01 Place the noodles in a large bowl and add hot water to cover (the water should feel hot to the touch, but should not be scalding). Let stand, stirring once or twice to separate any strands that are sticking together, for about 30 minutes; the noodles will become pliable but will not fully soften.\n\n02 Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the tamarind pulp and boiling water; stir with a fork to break up the pulp. Cover and let stand for about 30 minutes. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve set over another small bowl; press on the solids and be sure to scrape the underside of the sieve to collect the pulp that clings; you should have about ¼ cup. Wipe out the small bowl used to hydrate the tamarind, then measure 3 tablespoons of the strained tamarind into it (reserve the remainder for another use). Add the sugar, oyster sauce, soy sauce and fish sauce. Stir until the sugar dissolves; place near the stove.\n\n03 Drain the noodles in a colander. Shake the colander to remove excess water and set near the stove. In a medium bowl, toss together the bean sprouts, chives and peanuts; also set near the stove.\n\n04 In a 12- to 14-inch wok over high, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until smoking, swirling to coat. Add the shrimp and cook, stirring, until just beginning to curl and turn pink, 1 to 2 minutes; the shrimp will not be fully cooked. Transfer to a large plate; set aside. Wipe out the wok.\n\n05 Return the wok to high and heat 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil until smoking, swirling to coat. Add the shallot, garlic and pepper flakes; cook, stirring, until fragrant and lightly browned, 20 to 30 seconds. Add the eggs (they will immediately puff) and cook, stirring from the edges inward, until the curds are barely set and shiny, 20 to 30 seconds.\n\n06 Add half of the noodles. Cook, stirring, tossing and moving the noodles in a circular motion against the sides of the wok while also breaking up the eggs, until the noodles are dry, sizzling and no longer stark white in color, 1 to 1½ minutes. Drizzle the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil down the sides of the wok and add the remaining noodles; cook in the same way until the mixture is once again dry and sizzling.\n\n07 Pour half of the sauce mixture down the sides of the wok; it should bubble immediately and begin to thicken. Cook, tossing and moving the noodles in a circular motion against the sides of the wok, until the liquid is absorbed, about 30 seconds. Add the remaining sauce mixture and cook in the same way.\n\n08 Add the shrimp (discard any accumulated juices) and half of the bean sprout mixture. Cook, stirring, until the shrimp are opaque throughout and the sprouts are just wilted, 1 to 2 minutes. Taste the noodles; if they are still too firm, drizzle in water 2 tablespoons at a time and cook, stirring, until the noodles are tender. Toss in the remaining sprout mixture. Transfer to a platter and serve with lime wedges and chilies in vinegar (if using).\n\n09 To make Pad Thai with Tofu: Cut 8 ounces firm or extra-firm tofu into ½- to ¾-inch cubes. Place in a single layer on a plate lined with a double thickness of paper towels. Cover with additional paper towels, place another plate on top, then set a few cans or jars on top as weights; let stand while you soak the noodles, prepare the tamarind and mix the sauce ingredients. Follow the recipe, substituting the tofu for the shrimp and stir-frying until the tofu is golden brown on all sides, about 3 minutes, setting it aside, then returning it to the wok as with the shrimp.\n\n10 Pad Thai with Ground Pork: Follow the recipe, omitting the shrimp. When the shallot, garlic and pepper flakes are fragrant and lightly browned, add 8 ounces ground pork; cook, stirring and breaking the pork into small bits, until the meat is lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Make a clearing in the center of the mixture and add the eggs to the clearing, then continue with the recipe.",

    "name": "Beef, Orange and Olive Stew",
    "ingredients": "6-7 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, well trimmed and cut into 2-inch cubes\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n4 medium carrots, peeled and cut crosswise into ½-inch rounds, divided\n3 anchovy fillets, patted dry\n2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n2 medium garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n1 medium yellow onion, chopped\n1 cup pitted Kalamata olives, rinsed, patted dry and chopped, divided\n2½ cups dry red wine\n1 medium red bell pepper, stemmed, seeded and cut into 1-inch pieces\n1 tablespoon grated orange zest, plus ⅓ cup orange juice\n2 teaspoons red wine vinegar\n1 cup lightly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped",
    "directions": "Heat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. In a large Dutch oven, toss the beef with 2 tablespoons salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Add ½ the carrots, the anchovies, oil, garlic and onion, then toss. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook for 2 hours.\n\nRemove the pot from the oven and stir in ½ cup of the olives. Return to the oven uncovered and cook until a knife inserted into a piece of beef meets no resistance, 1 to 1½ hours.\n\nUsing a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a large bowl, leaving the vegetables in the pot. Set a fine mesh strainer over a fat separator or medium bowl. Pour the meat juices into the strainer, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids. You should have about 2½ cups liquid; if needed, add with water.\n\nPour the wine into the now-empty pot and bring to a boil over medium-high, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the wine is reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, if you strained the meat juices into a bowl, use a spoon to skim off and discard the fat from the surface.\n\nPour the defatted meat juices into the pot and add the remaining carrots and the bell pepper. Return to a simmer and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the orange juice and beef. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce begins to cling to the meat, 3 to 6minutes.\n\nOff heat, stir in the remaining ½ cup olives, the orange zest, vinegar and half of the parsley. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Tip: Don’t forget to zest the orange before juicing it—it’s much easier to grate the zest from a whole orange than from one that’s been halved and squeezed. Don’t add all of the carrots to the pot with the beef. Adding some at the beginning gives the stew a subtle sweetness, but after hours of braising, these carrots are spent. We add more carrots near the end of cooking so that they are tender but still flavorful.",

If you must hold mashed potatoes before serving, place them in a heatproof bowl, cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap, and set the bowl over a pot of simmering water. Be sure to occasionally check the water level in the pan. The potatoes will remain hot and soft-textured for 1 hour.\n\n1. Place the potatoes and 1 tablespoon salt in a large saucepan and add enough water to cover the potatoes by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until a fork can be slipped easily into the center of the potatoes, about 18 minutes. Drain the potatoes.\n\n2. Set a food mill or ricer over the now-empty but still-warm saucepan. Working in batches, drop the potatoes into the hopper of the food mill or ricer and process into the saucepan.\n\n3. Stir in the milk and melted butter with a wooden spoon until incorporated. Gently fold in the sour cream.

    "directions": "01 \nIn a small bowl, stir together the ricotta, Parmesan, pepper flakes, oregano and ¼ teaspoon each salt and pepper; set aside. In a broiler-safe 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat the oil until shimmering. Add the sausage, garlic, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon pepper; cook, breaking the sausage into small bits, until browned, 5 to 8 minutes.\n\n02 \nAdd the tomatoes with juices, the tomato paste and 1½ cups water. Bring to a simmer, then reduce to medium and cook, uncovered and stirring, until slightly thickened and dots of oil have formed on the surface, 12 to 15 minutes. A few at a time, insert the broken lasagna noodles in the sauce, standing them up on a frilly edge; the pieces will be only partially submerged. Cover and cook, undisturbed, until the noodles begin to soften and slump into the sauce, 6 to 8 minutes.\n\n03 \nUncover, add another ½ cup water and stir, fully coating the noodles and submerging them in the sauce. Re-cover and cook, using a silicone spatula to scrape along the bottom of the pan and stir about every 5 minutes, until the pasta is al dente, 15 to 20 minutes. Near the end of cooking, if the sauce has thickened and the noodles begin to stick to the pan before they are al dente, stir in another ¼ cup water. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the broiler with a rack about 6 inches from the element.\n\n04 \nUncover the skillet. Dollop spoonfuls of the ricotta mixture onto the surface, then sprinkle evenly with the mozzarella. Broil, uncovered, until the surface and edges are brown, 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "description": "This dish, called lasagna in padella in Italian, takes a faster, less structured approach than traditional baked lasagna. We use regular lasagna noodles, not the no-boil variety, and cook them directly in a sauce of tomato and Italian sausage. There is a trick, though, to ensure the pasta doesn’t stick together as it cooks. We break each lasagna sheet into sections about 3 inches long and insert the pieces in the sauce, standing them up on a frilly side. After a few minutes, the noodles will soften enough that they can be stirred into the sauce and simmered with little risk of sticking. The dish is finished under the broiler after it’s topped with cheese, so be sure to use a broiler-safe 12-inch skillet\n**Tip:**\nDon’t forget to cover the skillet after adding the noodles. This is necessary to trap the steam needed to soften the pasta. After adding the ½ cup water to the noodle and sauce mixture, scrape along the surface of the pan to loosen any pieces of pasta on the bottom. Finally, don’t skip the 5-minute rest before topping with cheese. It’s important for even hydration.",

    "directions": "1. In a medium bowl, mix together olive oil, lemon juice and zest, red pepper flakes, rosemary, sage, and garlic.\n\n2. Using sharp kitchen shears or poultry shears, remove spine from chicken (reserve spine for stock or another use). Flatten chicken by placing it skin side up on a cutting board and applying firm pressure to the breastbone. Transfer to a baking dish, season all over with salt and pepper, add marinade, and rub all over chicken. Cover dish with plastic. Marinate, refrigerated, at least 30 minutes and up to overnight.\n\n3. Preheat oven, along with all cooking equipment for whichever setup you're using, including skillets, foil-wrapped bricks, chicken press, barbell weight, et cetera (see the \"Special Equipment\" section below for more info), to 475°F (245°C).\n\n4. Scrape marinade and minced aromatics off chicken as best you can. Using cooking spray or oil, grease the interior of the bottom skillet/roasting vessel. Lay chicken down in skillet, skin side up, arranging it so that it lies flat.\n\n5. Using cooking spray or oil, grease the bottom of the top weight. (Depending on your setup, this could be one side of the foil-wrapped bricks, or the bottom of the second skillet or chicken-press weight.) Press the top weight down on the chicken, making sure it evenly covers it and is in contact with both the breast and the legs.\n\n6. Transfer to oven and cook until thickest part of breast, close to bone, registers 150°F (66°C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 30 minutes.\n\n7. Remove chicken from oven, remove top weight, and let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Carve and serve with lemon wedges, drizzling fresh olive oil over chicken at the table.",

    "ingredients": "2 medium-size boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (12 oz. total), cut into 3/4-inch chunks\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 Tbs. plus 1 tsp. olive oil\n6 oz. curly endive (curly chicory), washed, dried, and chopped into 2-inch pieces (about 6 cups, loosely packed).\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1/4 tsp. coriander seed, crushed\n1/4 cup water or homemade or low-salt canned chicken broth\n1/2 cup orange juice, preferably freshly squeezed\n1 Tbs. good-quality white-wine vinegar\n1 Tbs. unsalted butter\n2 Tbs. minced fresh flat-leaf parsley\n2 Tbs. coarsely chopped toasted walnuts",
    "directions": "Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat 1 Tbs. of the oil in a medium sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the endive and cook, stirring frequently, until deep green but still crisp-tender, about 90 seconds. Transfer to a medium bowl.\n\nHeat another 1 Tbs. oil in the pan and add the chicken. When the underside of the chicken has turned deep golden brown (after about 1 minute), turn it with a metal spatula. Turn occasionally for even browning until almost cooked through, 3 to 5 minutes, and transfer to the bowl of endive.\n\nReduce the heat to medium, heat the remaining 1 tsp. oil in the pan, and then add the garlic and crushed coriander. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the water or broth, orange juice, and vinegar. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits in the pan and blend them into the sauce. Simmer vigorously until the sauce has reduced and thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the butter, stirring until blended. Stir in the chicken and endive along with any juices, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve sprinkled with the parsley and walnuts.",

    "ingredients": "10 cardamom pods, preferably green, smashed with chef's knife\n1 cinnamon stick\n2 inch piece fresh ginger, cut into 1/2-inch-thick coins and smashed with chef's knife\n½ teaspoon cumin seed\n3 quarts water\ntable salt\n4 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 1 1/2 pounds), trimmed of excess skin and fat and patted dry with paper towels\nground black pepper\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 medium onions, sliced thin (about 4 cups)\n2 medium jalapeño chiles, one seeded and chopped fine, the other chopped fine with seeds\n4 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 1/2 tablespoons)\n1 ¼ cups basmati rice\n½ teaspoon saffron threads, lightly crumbled\n¼ cup dried currants or raisins\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves",
    "directions": "This recipe requires a 3 1/2- to 4-quart saucepan about 8 inches in diameter. Do not use a large, wide Dutch oven, as it will adversely affect both the layering of the dish and the final cooking times. Begin simmering the spices in the water prior to preparing the remaining ingredients; the more time the spices have to infuse the water (up to half an hour), the more flavor they will give to the rice. Biryani is traditionally served with a cooling yogurt sauce; ideally, you should make it before starting the biryani to allow the flavors in the sauce to meld.\n\n1. Wrap cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, ginger, and cumin seed in small piece of cheesecloth and secure with kitchen twine. In 3 ½- to 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan about 8 inches in diameter, bring water, spice bundle, and 1 ½ teaspoons salt to boil over medium-high heat; reduce to medium and simmer, partially covered, until spices have infused water, at least 15 minutes (but no longer than 30 minutes).\n\n2. Meanwhile, season both sides of chicken thighs with salt and pepper and set aside. Heat butter in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until foaming subsides; add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and dark brown about edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Add jalapeños and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Transfer onion mixture to bowl, season lightly with salt, and set aside. Wipe out skillet with paper towels, return heat to medium-high, and place chicken thighs skin-side down in skillet; cook, without moving chicken, until well browned, about 5 minutes. Flip chicken and brown second side, 4 to 5 minutes longer; transfer chicken to plate and remove and discard skin. Tent with foil to keep warm.\n\n3. If necessary, return spice-infused water to boil over high heat; stir in rice and cook 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Drain rice through fine-mesh strainer, reserving ¾ cup cooking liquid; discard spice bundle. Transfer rice to medium bowl; stir in saffron and currants (rice will turn splotchy yellow). Spread half of rice evenly in bottom of now-empty saucepan using rubber spatula. Scatter half of onion mixture over rice, then place chicken thighs, skinned-side up, on top of onions; add any accumulated chicken juices. Evenly sprinkle with cilantro and mint, scatter remaining onions over herbs, then cover with remaining rice; pour reserved cooking liquid evenly over rice.\n\n4. Cover saucepan and cook over medium-low heat until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 30 minutes (if large amount of steam is escaping from pot, reduce heat to low). Run heatproof rubber spatula around inside rim of saucepan to loosen any affixed rice; using large serving spoon, spoon biryani into individual bowls, scooping from bottom of pot and serving 1 chicken thigh per person.",

    "directions": "In a blender, combine the shredded coconut and warm water. Let stand until the coconut begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Blend on high until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the mixture into a fine-mesh sieve set over a large saucepan. Press on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids.\n\nUsing a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the limes in strips; remove only the colored portion, not the white pith beneath. You will need a total of about 10 strips, each 2 to 3 inches long; add them to the saucepan. Juice the limes; you will need 3 tablespoons; set aside.\n\nTo the saucepan, add the coconut cream, coconut water, lemon grass, ginger, shallot, turmeric, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon white pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high, then reduce to low and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard the solids.\n\nFor oyster mushrooms, tear them into bite-size pieces. For shiitakes, stem and thinly slice them. Stir the mushrooms, then bring to a simmer over medium. Add the chicken, fish sauce, chili paste, sugar and ⅛ teaspoon white pepper. Simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the chicken is opaque throughout and the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in the lime juice and sliced chili. Taste and season with salt or fish sauce and white pepper. Serve sprinkled with cilantro.",
    "description": "Tom yum is a classic Thai soup that is spicy, sour and savory. It also is intensely fragrant and flavorful with Southeast Asian aromatics, including lemon grass, galangal and makrut lime leaves. On a recent trip to Bangkok, we learned to make tom yum gai—the chicken version—from home cook and food blogger Rawadee Yenchujit. Back home, we needed to substitute ginger and lime zest for the harder-to-find galangal and makrut lime leaves.** If you can find fresh galangal, use an equal amount in place of the ginger. And if you’re able to get fresh makrut, use 10 sets of leaves (they grow in pairs) in place of the lime zest.** The chili paste, sometimes referred to as chili “jam”—nam prik pao in Thai—is a common addition to tom yum. Made by blending shallots, garlic, dried chilies, shrimp paste, tamarind, oil and other ingredients, the paste brings added complexity and color to the soup, along with a touch of fat that helps carry the flavors. Thai Kitchen roasted chili paste is sold in small jars in the international aisle of most supermarkets. If you like, serve the soup with steamed jasmine rice.",

Cook, undisturbed, until falafel is golden brown and edges are crisped, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to plate, falafel-side-up. Repeat with remaining oil and pita, adding 1 teaspoon oil to skillet in between each pita.\n\nTop falafel with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, chopped cucumber, and pickles. Drizzle with tahini sauce and zhug, if desired. Fold pitas in half over fillings and serve warm.\n\nSerrated knife, palette knife\n\nThese pitas are best eaten immediately, but you can prepare all the components (falafel mixture, sauces, veggies) one day in advance and store them in separate airtight containers in the fridge.",
    "description": "WHY IT WORKS\n- Steaming dry pitas in the microwave makes them more pliable so the sandwich doesn't crack when folded.\n- Cooking the pita falafel-side down keeps it crispy, while leaving the pita side uncooked makes it easy to fold in half. \n- Incorporating fillings like veggies and pickles adds brightness and crunch, while tahini sauce ties the flavors together.

Put the cucumbers in the large bowl and add the crushed peanuts, lemon juice, cilantro and chili; toss to coat.\n\nIn a small saucepan over medium, combine the oil, cumin seeds and mustard seeds. Cook, swirling the pan, until sizzling and fragrant, about 2 minutes. Pour the mixture over the cucumbers and stir.

    "directions": "1. Bring a large stockpot with water to boil over high heat. When it comes to a rolling boil, add the beef bones and boil vigourously for 10 minutes.\n\n2. In the meantime, heat a frying pan on medium-low heat. Add the Vietnamese Pho Spices and toast until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Dump the spices to the empty Crock Pot or slow cooker immediately. Return frying pan to medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil is hot, add the ginger slices and the onion half. Cook until the ginger is browned on both sides and the onion half is nicely browned and softened. Add the ginger and the onion to the Crock Pot or slow cooker.\n\n3. When the bones have been pre-boiled, drain, discard water and rinse bones briefly to clean them. Add the bones to the Crock Pot or slow cooker. Fill the Crock Pot with fresh, clean, cool water to just 1-1/2 inches below surface, add the fish sauce and sugar. Cover and set the Crock Pot or slow cooker to cook on low for 8 hours. Taste and season with additional fish sauce if needed.\n\n4. When you are just about ready to eat, you'll prep the rest of the ingredients for the Pho bowls. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the beef balls and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove the balls, keeping the water boiling and now cook the noodles according to package instructions. If you are using fresh noodles, all they need is a couple of minutes. Drain immediately.\n\n5. Strain the stock with a fine meshed sieve. Discard the solids.\n\n6. Line up 4 large bowls on counter. Distribute the noodles, beef balls and thin steak slices evenly amongst the bowls. Ladle the hot Pho stock into each bowl. The hot stock should cook the thin steak slices. Serve with lime wedges, fresh herbs, chili peppers, Hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot chili sauce at the table.",

    "directions": "Process flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in food processor until combined, about 3 seconds. With processor running, slowly add cold water and oil and process until dough forms sticky ball that clears sides of bowl, 30 to 60 seconds.\n\nTransfer dough to counter and knead until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape dough into tight ball and place in greased bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let dough rise at room temperature until almost doubled in size, 2 to 2½ hours. (Alternatively, dough can rise in refrigerator until doubled in size, about 24 hours. Let come to room temperature, about 2 hours, before proceeding.)\n\nTurn out dough onto lightly floured 16 by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper and coat lightly with flour. Flatten into 8-inch disk using your hands. Using rolling pin, roll dough into 12-inch circle, dusting dough lightly with flour as needed.\n\nRoll bottom edge of dough 2½ inches in toward center. Rotate parchment 180 degrees and roll bottom edge of dough (directly opposite first rolled side) 2½ inches toward center. (Opposing edges of rolled sides should be 7 inches apart.)\n\nRoll ends of rolled sides toward centerline and pinch firmly together to form football shape about 12 inches long and about 7 inches across at its widest point. Transfer parchment with dough to rimmed baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic and let rise until puffy, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees.\n\nCombine mozzarella and feta in bowl. Fill dough with cheese mixture, lightly compacting and mounding in center (cheese will be piled higher than edge of dough). Bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown in spots, 15 to 17 minutes. Transfer sheet to wire rack. Add egg yolk and butter to cheese filling and stir with fork until fully incorporated and cheese is smooth and stretchy. Lift parchment off sheet and slide bread onto serving dish. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "Adjaruli khachapuri is a boat-shaped bread stuffed with melted cheese hailing from the country of Georgia in the Caucasus region of central Asia. When the bread is still hot from the oven, the molten cheese is topped with an egg and butter and stirred together tableside. Diners then tear off chunks of the crust to dunk into the gooey cheese. For our version, we used a simple pizza dough since it was easy to shape, provided structure to contain the oozy cheese, and had a satisfyingly chewy texture and mild flavor. We found that a mixture of mozzarella and feta approximated the briny, salty tang and stringy texture found in traditional Georgian cheeses such as sulguni and imeruli. Stirring in an egg yolk and a pat of butter right before serving kept the gooey cheese filling smooth and stretchy.",

Brush with the oil, then rub with the cut sides of the garlic clove; discard the garlic. Spread the mustard on the bread, dividing it evenly, then layer on the ham, tearing the slices as needed to fit. Divide the cheese over the ham, then top with the asparagus, crisscrossing the spears but not creating a solid layer so the cheese is visible underneath; you may not need to use all of the asparagus. Drizzle with additional oil and sprinkle with pepper.\n\n03 Broil until the edges of the bread are toasted, the cheese is light spotty brown and the asparagus begins to char, about 4 minutes.",

    "directions": "Season chicken generously with salt and pepper. Place chicken in zipper-lock bags or vacuum bags and add half of garlic, roughly chopped scallions, and all of ginger. Remove air from zipper-lock bags by closing the bags, leaving the last inch of the top unsealed. Slowly lower into a pot of water, sealing the bag completely just before it fully submerges. If using a vacuum bag, seal according to manufacturer instructions.\n\nIf Cooking in a Sous-Vide Precision Cooker: Preheat a sous-vide cooker to 150°F (66°C). Add chicken and cook for at least 1 hour and up to 4. Transfer to an ice bath and let chill for 15 minutes.\n\nIf Cooking in a Cooler: Heat 2 quarts of water in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it registers 155°F (68°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Transfer to a small cooler, add chicken, and seal cooler. Cook for at least 1 hour and up to 4, topping up with boiling water as necessary to maintain temperature of 150°F. Transfer to an ice bath and let chill for 15 minutes.\n\nWhile chicken cooks, grind Sichuan peppercorns in a mortar and pestle until a rough powder is formed. Add sugar, remaining 3 cloves garlic, and sesame seeds and pound until a rough paste is formed. Add sesame paste, soy sauce, and vinegar and pound until a smooth paste is formed. Stir in chile oil and sediment. Set dressing aside.\n\nWhen chicken is cooked, remove from bags and discard garlic, scallions, and ginger. Stir 2 tablespoons of juices from the bag into the dressing. Remove skin and bones from chicken and discard. Shred meat and transfer to a large bowl. Add dressing and sliced scallions.\n\nToss chicken to coat in dressing and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.

    "notes": "**Making Chili Oil**\nI've been playing around a lot with the method I use to make this classic Sichuan chile oil and vinegar sauce. My current favorite method is to break out the mortar and pestle, which helps bring out better flavor from all the aromatics as well as combine them into a neatly emulsified sauce. It's always way faster and easier to clean than a food processor or spice grinder.\n\nI start by grinding toasted Sichuan peppercorns to a fine powder before adding raw garlic, toasted sesame seeds, and a touch of sugar.\n\nOnce that's been worked into a paste, I start adding in the liquid ingredients: sesame paste (preferably Chinese, though tahini works just fine), soy sauce, and Chinkiang vinegar, along with a good amount of chile oil with its ground chile sediment. If you don't have access to good Chinese chile oil, you can quite easily make your own at home by toasting a quarter cup of crushed Sichuan or Korean chiles in a microwave until fragrant (it takes about 15 seconds on a microwave-safe plate), then adding them to three-quarters of a cup of neutral canola oil in a small saucepan and heating it just until it starts to bubble. Pull it off heat, let it rest, and you've got yourself some killer roasted chile oil.",

    "ingredients": "1 tablespoon baking soda\n2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and halved crosswise\n7 tablespoons sugar\n¼ cup fish sauce\n2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger\n1 pound broccoli, florets cut into 1-inch pieces, stalks peeled and sliced ¼ inch thick\n2 teaspoons cornstarch\n½ teaspoon pepper\n½ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves and stems",
    "directions": "The saltiness of fish sauce can vary; we recommend Tiparos. When taking the temperature of the caramel in step 2, tilt the pan and move the thermometer back and forth to equalize hot and cool spots; also make sure to have hot water at the ready. This dish is intensely seasoned, so serve it with plenty of steamed white rice.\n\n1. Combine baking soda and 1 1/4 cups cold water in large bowl. Add chicken and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Rinse chicken in cold water and drain well.\n\n2. Meanwhile, combine sugar and 3 tablespoons water in small saucepan. Bring to boil over medium-high heat and cook, without stirring, until mixture begins to turn golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook, gently swirling saucepan, until sugar turns color of molasses and registers between 390 and 400 degrees, 4 to 6 minutes longer. (Caramel will produce some smoke during last 1 to 2 minutes of cooking.) Immediately remove saucepan from heat and carefully pour in 3/4 cup hot water (mixture will bubble and steam vigorously). When bubbling has subsided, return saucepan to medium heat and stir to dissolve caramel.\n\n3. Transfer caramel to 12-inch skillet and stir in fish sauce and ginger. Add chicken and bring to simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is fork-tender and registers 205 degrees, 30 to 40 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through simmering. Transfer chicken to serving dish and cover to keep warm.\n\n4. Bring 1 inch water to boil in Dutch oven. Lower insert or steamer basket with broccoli into pot so it rests above water; cover and simmer until broccoli is just tender, 4 1/2 to 5 minutes. Transfer broccoli to serving dish with chicken.\n\n5. While broccoli cooks, bring sauce to boil over medium-high heat and cook until reduced to 1 1/4 cups, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk cornstarch and 1 tablespoon water together in small bowl, then whisk into sauce; simmer until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in pepper. Pour 1/4 cup sauce over chicken and broccoli. Sprinkle with cilantro and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nTraditional Vietnamese-style caramel chicken promises a dish that balances a bittersweet caramel with salty and spicy flavors, but most recipes miss the mark. Cooking the caramel until it was a deep, dark color was key to achieving the right complex bittersweetness, while fish sauce (in a 1:4 ratio of fish sauce to caramel) lent the traditional balancing salty component. A combination of ginger and black pepper provided the right amount of heat. Cutting the boneless, skinless chicken thighs in half, rather than into smaller bits as called for in many of the recipes we found, gave the chicken more time to absorb the sauce, while a quick soak in a baking soda–water bath helped the chicken stay juicy over a longer cooking time that turned the meat ultratender. To complete the meal, we steamed broccoli to serve alongside.",

    "ingredients": "8 ounces white button mushrooms button or cremini, wiped clean and stems trimmed flush with cap \n2-3 tablespoons olive oil \nsalt and black pepper \n3 tablespoons herbes fines chives, tarragon, or chervil), finely chopped \n1 tablespoons butter \n8 eggs pastured eggs if you can get them) \n2-3 ounces cream cheese \n",
    "directions": "About an hour before dinner (or, earlier in the day), preheat the oven to 450º and adjust your baking rack to the middle position. In a medium bowl, drizzle the mushroom caps with olive oil, then add 1/4 tsp salt and pepper to taste. Toss well, making sure the mushrooms get coated with the oil (they will absorb it quickly). On a parchment-lined baking sheet, place the mushrooms stem-side down, spaced across the surface of the baking sheet, and roast for about 15-20 minutes, or until the bottoms are browned. Using tongs, flip the mushrooms and continue to bake another 5-10 minutes, or until the tops are browned. Remove to a bowl, and drizzle with more olive oil if they seem dry. Set aside or refrigerate until ready to use. Before using in the frittata, chop the mushrooms into quarters.\n\nPreaheat your oven broiler, and move the baking rack to the upper third of the oven.\n\nHeat a 12-in nonstick oven-proof skillet over medium heat, and add the butter.  While the butter melts, lightly beat your eggs in a large bowl with a pinch of salt and pepper and the herbes fines. Once the butter is melted, pour the eggs into the pan and stir with a rubber spatula. Add the chopped mushrooms to the eggs, scattering them evenly over the pan. Continue stirring, gently, until the egg starts to set through, about 4-5 minutes. Toward the end of the cooking time, dot pieces of cream cheese over the surface (if using a block, just break off chunks with your finger; if using a softer cheese, use a small spoon and dollop the cheese on top). Once frittata is almost fully set (it will still have some spots of liquid egg on top), transfer to the oven.\n\nBroil for about 3-4 minutes, until the top is puffy and brown. Remove from the oven and immediately slide onto a serving platter. Cut into wedges and serve immediately.\n\n",

    "ingredients": "**For the adobo marinade:**\nScant 1/2 cup good-quality guajillo or ancho powdered chile (the amount you’ll get from a typical 2-ounce spice jar)\n8 garlic cloves, peeled\n1 teaspoon dried oregano, preferably Mexican\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, preferably Mexican canela\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1/4 teaspoon ground cumin\n3 tablespoons vinegar (apple cider vinegar is common in Mexico)\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n\n**For finishing the dish:**\n1 1/2 pounds boneless pork loin\n1 large bunch (about 6 pieces) knob onions, root ends cut off, any withered green parts removed\nA little vegetable oil\nSalt\n2 limes , cut into wedges\nAbout 3/4 cup salsa–Chipotle Salsa is great here (especially when made with Oaxacan pasilla chiles in place of chipotles), as is Avocado-Tomatillo Salsa\n16 or more warm corn tortillas",
    "directions": "**Make the adobo marinade.**\nScoop the ancho powder into a blender or small food processor. Bring 1 ½ cups water to a boil, pour over the chile. In a small microwave-safe bowl, collect the garlic, cover with water and microwave at 100% for 1 minute. Drain and add to the blender or processor, along with the herb and spices, vinegar and salt.\n_Loosely cover_ the blender or secure the top of the processor and process until smooth, then scrape half of the marinade into a medium bowl. (Refrigerate the remaining marinade to use with fish, chicken, pork or beef on another day.)\n\n**Slice and marinate the meat.**\nThinly slicing the meat will be much easier if you freeze the pork loin for 45 minutes or so to firm it. Slice the pork crosswise into pieces that are a little less than ¼ inch thick. Wearing disposable gloves, rub each piece of pork generously on both sides with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours (preferably overnight).\n\n**Grill and serve.**\nLight a charcoal fire and let it burn until the coals are covered with gray ash but still very hot. Lightly oil the knob onions. Lay on the hottest part of the grill. Grill until lightly charred on one side, flip them over and lightly char the other side, about 5 minutes total. Move to the coolest part of the grill and let coast to complete tenderness in the center, about 12 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, chop into small pieces, sprinkle with salt and scoop into a serving bowl. Scoop the limes into another bowl and set out with the salsas and tortillas.\n\nA few slices at a time, grill the pork: Spray or brush the slices with oil and lay them on the hottest part of the grill. When charred in spots, about 1 minute, flip and grill the other side, about a minute more. Transfer to a cutting board, cut into thin strips, sprinkle with salt, scoop into a warm bowl and set out for all to put together their own tacos.",

    "name": "Grilled Caesar Salad",
    "ingredients": "DRESSING\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1 garlic clove, minced\n1/2 cup mayonnaise\n1/2 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1/4 cup)\n1 tablespoon white wine vinegar\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n1 tablespoon Dijon mustard\n2 anchovy fillets, rinsed\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil\n\nSALAD\n1 (12-inch) baguette, cut on bias into 5-inch-long, 1/2-inch-thick slices\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 garlic clove, peeled\n3 romaine lettuce hearts (18 ounces), halved lengthwise through cores\n1/2 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (1/4 cup)",
    "directions": "1. FOR THE DRESSING: Combine lemon juice and garlic in bowl and let stand for 10 minutes. Process mayonnaise, Parmesan, lemon-garlic mixture, vinegar, Worcestershire, mustard, anchovies, salt, and pepper in blender for about 30 seconds. With blender running, slowly add oil. Reserve 6 tablespoons dressing for brushing romaine.\n\n2. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\n3. FOR THE SALAD: Clean and oil cooking grate. Brush bread with oil and grill (over coals if using charcoal), uncovered, until browned, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to platter and rub with garlic clove. Brush cut sides of romaine with reserved dressing; place half of romaine, cut side down, on grill (over coals if using charcoal). Grill, uncovered, until lightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes. Move to platter with bread. Repeat. Drizzle romaine with remaining dressing. Sprinkle with Parmesan. Serve.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Adding smoky char to a Caesar salad sounded like a good idea, as long as we could avoid limp lettuce. Using just the firm, compact romaine hearts is a step in the right direction, and grilling them over a hot fire lets them pick up char faster before wilting. We make a simple dressing with mayonnaise instead of raw eggs and brush some of it on the cut side of the lettuce before cooking to aid browning. Baguette slices brushed with oil crisp up in a few minutes, and we finish the whole thing with more dressing and plenty of Parmesan cheese.",

    "name": "Turkey Breast en Cocotte with Pan Gravy",
    "ingredients": "1 turkey breast, whole, bone-in (6- to 7-pound)\nSalt and ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1 medium onion, chopped medium\n1 medium carrot, chopped medium\n1 celery rib, chopped medium\n6 medium garlic cloves, peeled and crushed\n2 sprigs fresh thyme\n1 bay leaf\n¼ cup unbleached all-purpose flour\n4 cups low-sodium chicken broth",
    "directions": "Adjust an oven rack to the lowest position and heat the oven to 250 degrees. Using kitchen shears or a chef’s knife, trim the rib bones and any excess fat from the turkey, following the illustration at right. Pat the turkey dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.\n\nHeat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add the turkey, breast side down and scatter the onion, carrot, celery, garlic, thyme, and bay leaf around the turkey. Cook, turning the breast on its sides and stirring the vegetables as needed, until the turkey and vegetables are well browned, 12 to 16 minutes, reducing the heat if the pot begins to scorch. Turn turkey so breast side is facing up.\n\nOff the heat, place a large sheet of foil over the pot and press to seal, then cover tightly with the lid. Transfer the pot to the oven and cook until the thickest part of the breast registers 160 to 165 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours.\n\nRemove the pot from the oven. Transfer the turkey to a cutting board, tent loosely with foil, and let rest while making the gravy.\n\nPlace the pot with the juices and vegetables over medium-high heat and simmer until almost all of the liquid has evaporated, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring constantly, until browned, 2 to 5 minutes. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth, bring to a simmer and cook, stirring often, until the gravy is thickened and measures about 2 1/2 cups, 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nStrain the gravy through a fine-mesh strainer and season with salt and pepper to taste. Carve the turkey and serve, passing the gravy separately.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nMany supermarkets are now selling “hotel-style” turkey breasts. Try to avoid these if you can, as they still have the wings attached. If this is the only type of breast you can find, you will simply need to remove the wings before proceeding with the recipe. Be sure to use a 7- to 8-quart Dutch oven here. Don’t buy a turkey breast larger than 7 pounds; it won’t fit in the pot. For a smaller turkey breast, reduce the cooking time as necessary.",

    "directions": "01 In a 12-inch skillet over medium, heat 1 tablespoon of the oil until shimmering. Add the pancetta and cook, stirring, until well-browned and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a paper towel–lined plate and set aside.\n\n02 Return the skillet to medium and add the garlic; cook, stirring, until light golden brown, about 2 minutes. Stir in the pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the wine, increase to medium-high and cook, stirring, until most of the liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the drained tomatoes and cook, stirring, until heated, about 2 minutes. Stir in 3 tablespoons of the reserved tomato juice, then remove from the heat.\n\n03 Meanwhile, in a large pot, bring 2 quarts of water and the pecorino chunk to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent the cheese from sticking to the pot. Stir in the pasta and 1 teaspoons salt. Cook, stirring often, until the pasta is just shy of al dente. Remove and discard the pecorino, then drain the pasta in a colander set in a large heat-safe bowl; reserve the cooking water.\n\n04 Set the skillet over medium-high, stir in 1½ cups of the reserved pasta water and bring to a simmer. Add the drained pasta, tossing with tongs. Cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid has been absorbed, 3 to 6 minutes. Off heat, stir in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, the pancetta and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve with grated pecorino on the side.",
    "description": "Amatriciana is a minimalist equation of pasta, tomatoes, guanciale and pecorino Romano cheese, and in Rome it’s served with barely any sauce, as we learned from Mario Ive, retired artillery colonel in the Italian army and cookbook author. The cooking method using as little liquid as possible when cooking the sauce concentrates flavors in the sauce, which coats the pasta nicely. We apply that principle for the pasta in this recipe, as well, cooking spaghetti in half the amount of water (2 quarts) we usually use. To that we add a chunk of pecorino Romano, which infuses the noodles with rich, savory flavor. We also undercook the pasta, allowing it to finish cooking in the sauce. One 14½-ounce can of whole tomatoes, drained and cooked down, is plenty to dress four servings. Likewise, just 3 ounces of pancetta more widely available than guanciale provides ample flavor. Be sure to purchase thinly sliced pancetta and chop it finely to ensure the pieces crisp well.\n",
    "notes": "Don’t boil the pasta until al dente. Drain it when it's a minute or two shy of al dente; it will continue to cook when added to the sauce in the skillet.",

(You want to take the seasoning here to about 90% of what you like—we’ll finish seasoning at the end.) Cover and cook for 45 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.\n\nRemove the chicken from the pot and let it drain and cool in a large bowl.\n\nWhile it’s cooling, start your rice. (I use my Anyday, which turns your microwave into a giant steamer.) I add about half white rice, half leftover broth from the boiled chicken and microwave it uncovered for 8 minutes. Then, I finish with a little more broth, cover it, and microwave for 2 more minutes.\n\nWhile the rice is cooking, we’re going to make a scallion sauce for the chicken rice. Chop up a few cloves of garlic and add them to a pot with a few good glugs of olive oil on the stove. Cook until the garlic is sizzling, then pour over sliced scallions.\n\nOnce the chicken is cooled, slice off the breasts, then pick apart the dark meat. Bring your leftover broth to a simmer and add about three to four cups of vegetables, whatever you have in your refrigerator—for me, that’s mushrooms, scallions, a potato, and cabbage. (I also like to add a stick of butter, but that’s up to you.) Break up 2 packs of Momofuku Soy & Scallion Noodles and add those to the pot. We’re going for more of a Korean Sujebi here, so we don’t want the noodles to be perfect. Once your soup is ready, add your picked dark meat. Don’t add it too soon or the texture of chicken will be ruined. Adjust the seasoning with more Momofuku Savory Seasoned Salt and Momofuku Soy Sauce.\n\nServe your chicken breasts with the cooked rice, the scallion sauce, and our Momofuku Chili Crunch alongside the chicken soup.",
    "description": "I love roasted chicken. But with roasted chicken, there are only so many things you can do after it’s cooked. Boiled chicken is what I grew up with. It’s a lot more versatile—and easy. You get the meat, which we’re going to turn into chicken rice, plus you get the broth, which we’re turning into a soup.",

    "ingredients": "Software\n1 (8-ounce) skin-on fish fillets, such as rainbow trout, brown trout or small salmon\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 cup all-purpose flour, for dredging\n1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1 tablespoon drained capers, not rinsed\n1/2 medium lemon, juiced\n2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley (optional)",
    "directions": "Heat a 12-inch heavy pan over medium-high heat.\n\nMeanwhile, season the fish on the meat side with salt and pepper. Lightly dredge in flour and shake off excess.\n\nWhen the pan is good and hot, add the oil followed immediately by 1 tablespoon of the butter. As soon as the foaming subsides, place the fish in pan, flesh side down. Jiggle the pan for the first 10 seconds of cooking to keep the fish from sticking, then continue to cook until a golden crust forms on the fish, about 2 minutes. If the fat in the pan starts smoking around the edges, drop the heat a bit.\n\nUsing a slotted spatula or fish turner, carefully turn the fish away from you and again jiggle the pan for the first few seconds. Continue to cook until the skin turns golden brown, about 2 more minutes. Remove to a warm plate.\n\nPour out the cooking fat, then add the remaining butter and the capers. Cook until the capers begin to crisp, then remove the pan from the heat, add lemon juice to pan and swirl until the sauce thickens slightly. Pour the sauce over the fish, garnish if parsley, if desired, and serve.",

Place onion, vinegar, garlic, and salt in bowl and toss to combine. Using your hands or metal spoon, remove inner crumb from baguette bottom to create trough, leaving ¼-inch border on sides and bottom. Place baguette halves cut side up on baking sheet and bake until very lightly toasted, 5 minutes.\n\nPulse olives, parsley, capers, marjoram, and anchovies in food processor until coarsely but evenly chopped, 10 to 12 pulses. Transfer olive mixture to bowl with onion mixture. Add ¼ cup oil, mustard, and pepper and toss to combine.\n\nBrush inside of each baguette half with 1 tablespoon oil. Place two-thirds of olive mixture in hollow of baguette bottom and spread evenly. Distribute tuna evenly over olive mixture and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Shingle tomato slices over tuna. Shingle egg slices over tomato. Top eggs with remaining olive mixture and cap with baguette top (sandwich will be very full).\n\nPress gently on sandwich and slice in half crosswise on bias. Wrap each half tightly in plastic wrap. Place rimmed baking sheet on top of sandwiches and weight with heavy Dutch oven or two 5-pound bags of flour or sugar for 1 hour, flipping sandwiches halfway through weighting. (Wrapped sandwiches can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let come to room temperature before serving.)\n\nUnwrap sandwiches, slice each sandwich in half (or in thirds to serve 6) on bias, and serve.",

    "directions": "1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. AS soon as oven reaches 200 degrees, turn it off. (This will be warm proofing box for dough. Do not begin step 2 until oven has been turned off.) Line rimmed baking sheet with greased parchment paper. Using double layer of aluminum foil, create eight 132 by 2-inch strips, then shape each into 4-inch circle and secure with staples. Grease inside of collars and place on prepared sheet. \n\n2. Combine warm water, honey, and yeast in medium bowl and let sit until bubbly, about 5 minutes. Whisk in eggs, oil, and vinegar. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix almond flour, arrowroot flour, coconut flour, psyllium husk, and salt together on low speed until combined, about 1 minute. Slowly add yeast mixture and let dough come together, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium and beat until sticky and uniform, about 6 minutes. (Dough will resemble loose cookie dough.) \n\n3. Moisten your hands and divide dough into 8 equal pieces (342 ounces). Working with 1 piece of dough at a time, roll into rough round and place in foil collar. Cover loosely with plastic wrap, place sheet in warmed oven, and let rise for 10 minutes; do not let plastic touch oven rack. \n\n4 Remove sheet from oven and jet sit on counter until dough has doubled in size, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, neat oven to 400 degrees. \n\n5. Reduce oven temperature to $50 degrees. Remove plastic and adjust foil collars as needed to be flush with sheet. Spray rolls with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds, if using. Set sheet with rolls inside second rimmed baking sheet and bake until rolls are golden brown and firm, 30 to 35 minutes, rotating sheet and removing foil collars halfway through baking. \n\n6. Transfer rolls to wire rack and let cool completely before serving, about 1 hour. (Split rolls can be wrapped in double layer of plastic wrap and stored at room temperature for up to 2 days or frozen for up to 1 month. If frozen, microwave at 50 percent power for 1 minute then toast until golden.) ",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS Too often, paleo friendly sandwich breads turn out dry, crumbly, and dense or spongy, webby, and almost custard-like: plus, they usually lack the structure needed to stand up to a substantial filling. We wanted a hearty, sturdy Sandwich roll that would taste great. To create good Structure, we needed to use multiple flours and starches. For the base of our rolls we decided to use almond flour for its neutral flavor. Arrowroot flour was also essential, since the pure starch lightened the texture of the rolls and helped absorb moisture. Since we were after a bready flavor and texture, we used yeast as our leavener and added enough water to make a dough. But these ingredients alone didn’t give our rolls much structure—nor did they taste very good. A couple of eggs provided better structure and offered some subtle richness. Psyllium husk powder, a common ingredient in gluten-free breads, gave the rolls a more open crumb by creating a sturdier protein network. It also contributed a pleasant, wheaty flavor. Some cider vinegar gave the rolls a sourdough-like tang, while honey, olive oil, and salt rounded out the flavor nicely. But the rolls were still turning out rather wet and dense. We tried reducing the amount of water. But since we were counting on the water to create steam and help the rolls rise in the oven, we couldn't reduce the amount enough to get rid of the wetness. Instead, we added some coconut flour to the dough, which easily absorbed the excess liquid without making the rolls crumbly. Finally, since the dough was fairly soft and tended to spread in the oven, we made foil collars to hold the dough in place during proofing and some of the baking time. Halfway through baking, we removed the collars to ensure even browning. A sprinkling of sesame seeds before baking was a welcome final touch. ",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nInspired by an innovative macaroni and cheese recipe that calls for adding sodium citrate, an emulsifying salt, to cheese to keep it smooth when heated (instead of adding flour to make a béchamel), we based our sauce on American cheese, which contains a similar ingredient. Because American cheese has plenty of emulsifier but not a lot of flavor, we combined it with more-flavorful extra-sharp cheddar. A bit of mustard and cayenne pepper added piquancy. We cooked the macaroni in a smaller-than-usual amount of water (along with some milk), so we didn’t have to drain it; the liquid that was left after the elbows were hydrated was just enough to form the base of the sauce. Rather than bake the mac and cheese, we sprinkled crunchy, cheesy toasted panko bread crumbs on top. Our simplified mac and cheese recipe takes only about 20 minutes from start to finish.",

    "description": "This Thai soup contains generous amounts of shrimp and rice noodles—along with oyster mushrooms and cherry tomatoes—in a highly aromatic broth bursting with hot, sour, salty, and sweet flavors. We created vibrancy by smashing galangal, scallions, lemongrass, makrut lime leaves, and Thai chiles to release their flavorful oils and then simmering them in store-bought chicken broth. Then we rounded out the classic flavor profile with more distinct ingredients: fish sauce, lime juice, cilantro, and Thai basil. Finally, we added a dollop of homemade nam prik pao, a Thai chili jam that offers robust sweet, savory, and slightly spicy notes. ",

    "ingredients": "1 small garlic clove, minced\n1 ½ teaspoons apple cider vinegar\n4 yellow squashes and/or zucchini (8 ounces each), trimmed\n7 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil\nSalt and pepper\n⅓ cup chopped fresh mint\n2 tablespoons pistachios, toasted and chopped",
    "directions": "Be sure to start checking for doneness at the lower end of the cooking time.\n\n1. Combine garlic and vinegar in large bowl and set aside for at least 10 minutes. Using vegetable peeler, shave each squash lengthwise into ribbons. Peel off 3 ribbons from 1 side, then turn squash 90 degrees and peel off 3 more ribbons. Continue to turn and peel ribbons until you reach seeds. Discard core.\n\n2. Whisk 2 tablespoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/8 teaspoon pepper into garlic mixture.\n\n3. Heat remaining 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add squash and cook, tossing occasionally with tongs, until squash has softened and is translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer squash to bowl with dressing, add mint, and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to serving platter and sprinkle with pistachios. Serve immediately.\n\nTechnique: Making Squash Ribbons\n\nHolding squash at slight angle, peel from the top downward. Rotate squash every few strokes, stopping when you reach the seedy core. A stack of four ribbons should be only 1/4 inch thick.",
