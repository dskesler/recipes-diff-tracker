    "name": "Strawberry Pepper Icebox Cake",
    "ingredients": "1 cup strawberry preserves, divided\n1 (8-ounce) block cream cheese, softened\n1 cup sour cream\n1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 1/2 cups heavy cream, cold, divided\n1/4 cup powdered sugar\n13 graham crackers\n2 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper, divided",
    "directions": "Line an 8-by-4-by-3-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving enough overhang in each direction to completely cover the top. Measure out 2/3 cup of the strawberry preserves. Set both aside.\n\nBeat the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on high until fluffy, about 4 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Add the sour cream and lemon zest and beat until combined, about 30 seconds more. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.\n\nSwap the paddle for the whisk and whip 1/2 cup of the cream along with the powdered sugar on medium-high until stiff peaks form, about 3 minutes. Fold into the cream cheese mixture and transfer to a zip-top bag.\n\nCover the bottom of the prepared loaf pan with a layer of graham crackers. Snip the corner of the zip-top bag and pipe in approximately 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the whipped cream mixture and smooth with a spoon or spatula. (It's totally fine to eyeball this; just know you'll end up with 6 cream layers.) Top with about 3 tablespoons of preserves (again, it's fine to eyeball), followed by 1/2 teaspoon of pepper and another layer of whipped cream.\n\nContinue layering — crackers, whipped cream, preserves, pepper, whipped cream, crackers — until you have 4 layers of graham crackers (see Cook's Notes). Fold the excess plastic wrap over the cake and refrigerate 8 hours and up to 24.\n\nWhen ready to serve, whip the remaining 1 cup cream in the bowl of a stand mixer on medium-high until stiff peaks have almost formed. Drop the mixer to low and work in the remaining 1/3 cup strawberry preserves and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Boost the speed back to medium-high until stiff peaks form.\n\nPull back the plastic wrap and invert the cake onto a serving dish. Remove the plastic wrap completely and frost with the strawberry whipped cream. Slice and serve immediately.",

Stir the lime juice into the shrimp, then refrigerate, uncovered and stirring once or twice, until no longer warm, about 15 minutes, but no more than 30 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, heat an 8- or 10-inch skillet, preferably cast-iron, over medium-high until water flicked onto the surface immediately sizzles and evaporates. Add the Fresno chilies, chipotle chili and garlic; cook, occasionally turning each item, until charred in spots, 7 to 10 minutes. If charring at different rates, transfer each item to a plate when done.\n\nWhen cool enough to handle, stem and seed the chilies. In a blender, combine the charred chilies and garlic, Worcestershire, Maggi, soy sauce and ¼ teaspoon salt. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute. Stir the puree into the shrimp mixture. Let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes, then taste and season with salt.\n\nIn a wide, shallow serving bowl, evenly distribute the onion and cucumber. Using a slotted spoon, arrange the shrimp on top, then pour the sauce over them. Top with the avocado and tomato.",

    "ingredients": "For the Chicken:\n5 tablespoons fresh juice from about 3 lemons\n4 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n4 tablespoons olive oil\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano leaves\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 pounds skinless boneless chicken breast, trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch pieces\n4 medium cloves garlic, grated (about 4 teaspoons)\nFor the Tzatziki Sauce:\n1 medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, cut into 1/4-inch cubes (see notes)\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 medium clove garlic, grated (about 1 teaspoon)\n1 cup Greek yogurt (see notes)\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill\nFor the Salad:\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n6 small tomatoes, cut into wedges\n2 small red onions, sliced thin\n1 medium cucumber, seeded and sliced into thin half moons\n3/4 cup pitted Kalamata olives\n6 ounces crumbled feta\n1/4 cup chopped parsley\n6 pitas",
    "directions": "In a medium bowl, whisk lemon juice, vinegar, olive oil, oregano, salt, and black pepper. Place chicken cubes in a separate medium bowl. Mix in grated garlic and 7 tablespoons of dressing. Toss chicken to coat evenly, cover, and refrigerate to marinate for about 2 hours, tossing occasionally. Set remaining dressing aside for salad.\n\nWhile the chicken marinates, make the tzatziki sauce: Place cubed cucumbers in a strainer set over a bowl. Toss with 1/2 teaspoon salt and let sit to drain, about 30 minutes. Gently pat cucumbers dry with paper towel, place in small bowl, and mix with garlic, yogurt, and dill. Season to taste with salt. Refrigerate until ready to serve.\n\nSkewer chicken pieces on 8 to 12 skewers. Discard used marinade. Heat grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Place chicken skewers on grill (or cook in batches on grill pan) until well browned and internal temperature registers 155°F (68°C) on an instant-read thermometer, turning evenly to cook on all sides, about 5 minutes total. (Adjust temperature of grill if necessary.) Remove chicken to a serving platter and let rest 3 minutes. Meanwhile, briefly grill pitas and keep warm.\n\nJust before serving, prepare the salad: Whisk olive oil into reserved chicken marinade. Add tomatoes, onions, cucumber, olives, feta, and parsley. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nServe skewers with salad, pita, and tzatziki sauce. Remove chicken from skewers to stuff into pitas with sauce and salad.",

    "directions": "1. Toss 4 tablespoons oil, potatoes, onion, ½ teaspoon salt, and pepper in large bowl until potato slices are thoroughly separated and coated in oil. Heat 2 tablespoons oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Reduce heat to medium-low, add potato mixture to skillet, and set bowl aside without washing. Cover and cook, stirring with rubber spatula every 5 minutes, until potatoes offer no resistance when poked with tip of paring knife, 22 to 28 minutes (it’s OK if some potato slices break into smaller pieces).\n\n2. Meanwhile, whisk eggs and remaining ½ teaspoon salt in reserved bowl until just combined. Using rubber spatula, fold hot potato mixture, red peppers, and peas into eggs until combined, making sure to scrape all potato mixture out of skillet. Return skillet to medium-high heat, add remaining teaspoon oil, and heat until just beginning to smoke. Add egg-potato mixture and cook, shaking pan and folding mixture constantly for 15 seconds. Smooth top of mixture with rubber spatula. Reduce heat to medium, cover, and cook, gently shaking pan every 30 seconds until bottom is golden brown and top is lightly set, about 2 minutes.\n\n3. Using rubber spatula, loosen tortilla from pan, shaking back and forth until tortilla slides around freely in pan. Following photos below, slide tortilla onto large plate. Invert tortilla onto second large plate and slide it browned-side up back into skillet. Tuck edges of tortilla into skillet with rubber spatula. Return pan to medium heat and continue to cook, gently shaking pan every 30 seconds, until second side is golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Slide tortilla onto cutting board or serving plate and allow to cool at least 15 minutes. Cut tortilla into cubes or wedges and serve with Garlic Mayonnaise, if desired.",

Stir the mayonnaise, cream cheese, Parmesan, lemon juice, thyme, and cayenne into the onion mixture until uniform, smearing any lumps of cream cheese against the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Gently fold in the chopped artichokes and season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the mixture to an ungreased 8-inch square baking dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly over the top.\n\n5. TO STORE: Cover the baking dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\n\n6. TO SERVE: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Unwrap the dip and bake, uncovered, until hot throughout and the bread crumbs are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Right off the bat, we knew we’d need to find a replacement for the tinny-tasting canned artichokes that most roasted artichoke dip recipes use. We liked frozen artichokes, which were passable if boiled, but far better if roasted with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Most artichoke dip recipes specify a 1-1 ratio of mayo to cheese; however, we found this made for a dip with a grainy texture. More mayonnaise remedied that, but the resulting batch lacked the creaminess we wanted. Adding sour cream made the dip’s flavor too tart, but a small amount of cream cheese produced a dip every bit as creamy as we wanted.",

    "directions": "FOR THE CRUST:\nUsing stand mixer fitted with paddle, mix flour blend, almond flour, psyllium, baking powder, salt, and yeast on low speed until combined. Slowly add warm water and oil in steady stream until incorporated. Increase speed to medium and beat until dough is sticky and uniform, about 6 minutes. (Dough will resemble thick batter.)\n\nRemove bowl from mixer, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand until inside of dough is bubbly (use spoon to peer inside dough), about 1 1/2 hours. (Dough will puff slightly but will not rise.)\n\nAdjust oven racks to middle and lower positions. Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper and spray liberally with oil spray. Transfer half of dough to center of 1 prepared sheet. Using oil-sprayed rubber spatula, spread dough into 8-inch circle. Spray top of dough with oil spray, cover with large sheet of plastic, and, using your hands, press out dough to 11 1/2-inch round, about 1/4 inch thick, leaving outer 1/4 inch slightly thicker than center; discard plastic. Repeat with remaining dough and second prepared sheet.\n\nPlace prepared sheets in oven and heat oven to 325 degrees. Bake dough until firm to touch, golden brown on underside, and just beginning to brown on top, 45 to 50 minutes, switching and rotating sheets halfway through baking. Transfer crusts to wire rack and let cool.\n\n**FOR THE SAUCE: **Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to bowl and refrigerate until ready to use.\n\n**One hour before baking pizza**, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position, set baking stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees.\n\nTransfer 1 par-baked crust to pizza peel. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce in thin layer over surface of crust, leaving 1/4-inch border around edge. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 1 cup mozzarella. Carefully slide crust onto stone and bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat with second crust, 1/2 cup tomato sauce (you will have extra sauce), remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan, and remaining 1 cup mozzarella.\n\n**TO MAKE AHEAD:** Extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to 1 week or frozen for up to 1 month. Parbaked and cooled crusts can sit at room temperature for up to 4 hours. Completely cooled crusts can be wrapped with plastic wrap and then aluminum foil and frozen for up to 2 weeks. Frozen crusts can be topped and baked as directed without thawing.",

Saute, tossing with a non-metal spatula until evenly and lightly golden brown. Sprinkle lightly with soy sauce, saute briefly to further brown tofu. Remove from skillet, draining and discarding any excess fluid.\n\nRinse and wipe skillet dry, lightly oil and place it over high heat. Allow oil to become very hot and add tofu. Saute tofu, tossing with a non-metal spatula almost constantly until very well browned. Sprinkle with soy sauce to taste. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast to coat tofu cubes and, tossing vigorously, saute for a few seconds and remove from heat. Keep warm in the oven while you finish cooking the veggies.\n\nSAUTEED VEGETABLES\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high to high heat. Add onions and saute until soft and translucent. Add bell pepper and saute for 1 or 2 minutes, until slightly cooked, but still firm. Add zucchini and yellow squash, and saute for another minute or two, until squash is slightly cooked but still firm. Add mushrooms and cook until they give up their water. (note- other veggies of your choice can be substituted; onions are always a good base, and the zucchini and yellow squash go well with the gravy, and so we always use these as a base, but we've also used other bell peppers, broccoli, carrots, and peas with tasty outcomes).\n\n",

Add the squeezed lemon peels and any unsqueezed lemon quarterspieces to a large jar, such as an 8-cup Mason jar, a wide pitcher or even a large bowl.\n\nAdd the sugar to the lemon peel pieces in the jar and, using a wooden spoon or a muddler, muddle together until the sugar has mostly dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. \n\nAdd the lemon juice to the jar, cover and shake vigorously (or stir, if your vessel doesn’t have a lid) to ensure the sugar has fully dissolved. Add the water, then add pickle juice to taste. Shake or stir to mix; then strain using a fine-mesh strainer. (To store, refrigerate up to 3 days.)\n\nTo serve, pour into glasses over plenty of ice. Garnish with a lemon slice and a pickle spear.",

    "notes": "Because conventional lemons are often sprayed with pesticides, this recipe calls for organic lemons. If using conventional lemons, be sure to wash the fruit thoroughly. The size and juiciness of lemons can vary; save any leftover lemon for another use.\n\nWhen choosing pickles for this recipe, look for refrigerated dill-flavored ones like Grillo’s, for brighter flavors. Sweet bread and butter pickles, or other pickles that use too much garlic or other seasonings, might overpower the balance of acidity (lemon), sweetness (sugar) and saltiness (pickle brine). Depending on your pickle choice, you may need to adjust the sugar and lemon ratios.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nThis Italian American dish pairs chicken with sausage and a tangy sauce based on bell peppers, onion, and pickled cherry peppers. We wanted our version to be bright and flavorful, not too briny and certainly not too spicy. We started by tempering the heat of the cherry peppers by removing their seeds. We wanted some extra flavor, so we added just a couple of tablespoons of the vinegary cherry pepper brine. After browning the sausage and chicken, we sautéed the vegetables and then nestled the chicken and sausage in the vegetables to finish cooking in the oven, which kept the chicken skin crispy. A tablespoon of flour and ¾ cup of chicken broth resulted in a sauce with the perfect consistency—thick enough to coat the chicken and sausage without being gloppy.",

    "directions": "1. FOR THE YOGURT-GARLIC SAUCE: Whisk all ingredients together in bowl. Set aside.\n\n2. FOR THE KOFTE: Process pine nuts, garlic, paprika, cumin, salt, pepper, coriander, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon in food processor until course paste forms, 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer mixture to large bowl. Add beef, onion, parsley, mint, and gelatin; knead with your hands until thoroughly combined and mixture feels slightly sticky, about 2 minutes. Divide mixture into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into 5-inch-long cylinder about 1 inch in diameter. Using 8 (12-inch) metal skewers, thread mixture onto skewers, pressing gently to adhere. Transfer skewers to lightly greased baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.\n\n3A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Using skewer, poke 12 holes in bottom of disposable pan. Open bottom vent completely and place disposable pan in center of grill. Light large chimney starter filled two-thirds with charcoal briquettes (4 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into disposable pan. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\n3B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.\n\n4. Clean and oil cooking grate. Place skewers on grill (directly over coals if using charcoal) at 45-degree angle to grate. Cook (covered if using gas), without moving them, until browned and meat easily releases from grill, 4 to 7 minutes. Flip skewers and continue to cook until browned on second side and meat register 160 degrees, about 6 minutes longer. Transfer skewers to large platter and serve, passing yogurt-garlic sauce separately.",

    "description": null,
    "notes": "To make sure that the breasts cook at the same rate, purchase two similarly sized whole breasts (not split breasts) with skins fully intact. Whole chicken breasts weighing about 1 1/2 pounds work best because they require a cooking time long enough to ensure that the skin will brown and crisp nicely. If you do not own a broiler pan, use a roasting pan fitted with a flat wire rack. This recipe can easily be increased by 50 or 100 percent. If you do increase it, just make certain not to crowd the chicken breasts on the broiler pan, which can impede the browning and crisping of the skin.",

    "ingredients": "**Topping**\n2 slices high-quality white sandwich bread, quartered\n2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted\n\n**Dip**\n1 (9-ounce) box frozen artichokes (do not thaw)\n1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry\n2 tablespoons olive oil\nSalt and ground black pepper\n1 medium onion, minced\n2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\n1 cup mayonnaise\n4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature\n4 ounces Gouda, shredded\n1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (about ½ cup)\n2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon\n1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves\nPinch cayenne pepper",
    "directions": "1. FOR THE TOPPING: Pulse the bread in a food processor to coarse crumbs, about 6 pulses. Toss the bread crumbs with the Parmesan and butter; set aside.\n\n2. FOR THE DIP: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil. Toss the artichokes with 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and spread out over the prepared baking sheet. Roast the artichokes, stirring occasionally, until browned at the edges, about 25 minutes. Let the artichokes cool and then chop coarse.\n\n3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just shimmering. Add the onion and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and chopped spinach and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer the onion and spinach mixture to a large bowl and set aside.\n\n4. Stir the mayonnaise, cream cheese, Parmesan, lemon juice, thyme, and cayenne into the onion mixture until uniform, smearing any lumps of cream cheese against the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Gently fold in the chopped artichokes and season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the mixture to an ungreased 8-inch square baking dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly over the top.\n\n5. TO STORE: Cover the baking dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\n\n6. TO SERVE: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Unwrap the dip and bake, uncovered, until hot throughout and the bread crumbs are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.",

We liked frozen artichokes, which were passable if boiled, but far better if roasted with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Most artichoke dip recipes specify a 1-1 ratio of mayo to cheese; however, we found this made for a dip with a grainy texture.

    "directions": "01 Heat the oven to 450°F with a rack in the middle position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack on top. In a small saucepan over medium, melt the butter. Add the garlic and cumin, then cook, swirling the pan, until the seeds sizzle, 60 to 90 seconds. Stir in the paprika, cayenne and 1 teaspoon black pepper. Cook until the spices are fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove from heat and whisk in the cilantro, parsley, sugar and lemon juice; set aside.\n\n02 Using a sharp knife, cut parallel slashes on each chicken leg about 1 inch apart all the way to the bone on both sides of each leg. Season all over with salt, then brush both sides with about half of the butter mixture. Place the chicken skin up on the prepared rack and roast for 10 minutes.\n\n03 Brush the remaining butter mixture onto the surface of the chicken. Continue to roast until well browned and the thickest part of the thigh reaches 175°F, about another 15 minutes.\n\n04 Transfer the chicken to a serving platter and let rest for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro and parsley leaves, then serve with lemon wedges on the side.",
    "description": "This recipe is our weeknight adaptation of djej mechoui, which translates from the Arabic as “grilled chicken.” Made the Moroccan way, the bird is seasoned with spices and herbs, along with smen, or fermented butter, before cooking. For our version, we throw together a simple spice-and-herb infused butter and brush it onto chicken leg quarters that then are roasted in a hot oven. The best way to lightly crush the cumin seeds is with a mortar with a pestle, or you can pulse them in a spice grinder. Either way, be careful not to process them to a powder so they retain their texture. Smoked paprika is a Spanish spice, but it lends rich color along with a flavor evocative of outdoor grilling.",
    "notes": "Don’t be shy about cutting through the skin and meat when slashing the chicken. Make sure to cut all the way to the bone so the seasonings can go deep. The slashes also help speed up the cooking.",

    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to lowest position, set pizza stone on oven rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. In liquid measuring cup, whisk yeast into water to dissolve. In food processor fitted with metal blade, process flours, salt, and sugar until combined, about 5 seconds. With machine running, slowly add liquid through feed tube; continue to process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of workbowl, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. (If after 1 minute dough is sticky and clings to blade, add 1 to 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour and continue processing. If dough appears dry and crumbly, add 1 to 2 tablespoons water and process until dough forms ball.) Divide dough in half and shape into smooth, tight balls (see photo 1, below). Place on floured counter or baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart; cover loosely with plastic wrap coated with nonstick cooking spray and let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\n\nIn clean bowl of food processor, process tomatoes until crushed, two or three 1-second pulses. Transfer tomatoes to fine-mesh strainer set over bowl and let drain at least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to release liquids. Just before shaping pizza rounds, combine drained tomatoes, sugar, garlic (if using), 1 tablespoon basil, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in bowl.\n\nWhen dough balls have doubled in size, dust dough liberally with flour and transfer balls to well-floured work surface. Press one ball into 8-inch disk (photo 2). Using flattened palms, gently stretch disk into 12-inch circle, working along outer edge and giving disk quarter turns (photos 3 and 4). Lightly flour pizza peel; lift edges of dough round to brush off any excess flour, then transfer dough to peel. Spread thin layer of tomato topping (about 1/2 cup) over dough with rubber spatula, leaving 1/2-inch border around edge. Slide onto stone and bake until crust begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Remove pizza from oven with peel, close oven door, and top pizza with half of cheese chunks, spaced evenly apart. Return pizza to stone and continue cooking until cheese is just melted, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to cutting board; sprinkle with half of remaining basil, 1 teaspoon olive oil, and pinch salt. Slice and serve immediately. Repeat step 3 to shape, top, and bake second pizza.\n\n",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "This recipe requires a pizza stone and a peel. Convection ovens will produce a lighter, crispier pizza, and you will need to reduce the overall cooking time by a minute or two. You can shape the second dough round while the first pizza bakes, but don’t add toppings until just before baking. You can let the dough rise overnight in the refrigerator if you like; place the dough balls on a floured baking sheet and cover with plastic wrap coated with nonstick cooking spray. If using mozzarella packed in brine, pat the cheese cubes dry before placing them on the pizza.",

    "directions": "Place the macaroni in a large saucepan and cover it with salted water by 2 inches. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally to keep the pasta from sticking.

Toss the cheeses with the cornstarch in a large bowl until thoroughly combined.\n\nWhen the pasta is cooked, drain it and return it to the saucepan. Place over low heat, add the butter, and stir until melted. Add the milk mixture and cheese mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until the cheese is completely melted and the mixture is hot and creamy. Season to taste with salt and more hot sauce.

    "description": "Starting the pasta in cold water works just as well as adding it to already-boiling water but cooks faster and with less energy.\n\nA combination of multiple thickeners and emulsifying agents—cornstarch, evaporated milk, eggs, and American cheese—ensures an extra-gooey texture with real cheese flavor.",
    "notes": "Use a good melting cheese or combination thereof, like American, cheddar, Jack, Fontina, young Swiss, Gruyere, Muenster, young provolone, and/or young Gouda. To reheat the pasta, add a few tablespoons of milk to the pan and cook, stirring gently, over medium-low heat until hot.",

    "ingredients": "Salt and pepper\n4 russet potatoes, unpeeled, each lightly pricked with fork in 6 places\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil",
    "directions": "Open up the potatoes immediately after removal from the oven in step 3 so steam can escape. Top them as desired, or with one of our toppings.\n\n1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Dissolve 2 tablespoons salt in 1/2 cup water in large bowl. Place potatoes in bowl and toss so exteriors of potatoes are evenly moistened. Transfer potatoes to wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and bake until center of largest potato registers 205 degrees, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n\n2. Remove potatoes from oven and brush tops and sides with oil. Return potatoes to oven and continue to bake for 10 minutes.\n\n3. Remove potatoes from oven and, using paring knife, make 2 slits, forming X, in each potato. Using clean dish towel, hold ends and squeeze slightly to push flesh up and out. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nTo produce baked potatoes with an evenly fluffy interior, we figured out their ideal doneness temperature: 205 degrees. Baking them in a hot (450-degree) oven prevents a leathery “pellicle” from forming underneath the peel. To season the skin, we coat the potatoes in salty water before baking; we crisp the skin by painting it with vegetable oil once the potatoes are cooked through and then baking the potatoes for an additional 10 minutes.",

Freeze meat until firm and starting to harden around edges but still pliable, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nPlace half of meat in food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped, 5 to six 1-second pulses. Transfer ground meat to medium bowl and repeat with remaining chunks. Stir 1 tablespoon fish sauce into ground meat and marinate, refrigerated, 15 minutes.\n\nHeat rice in small skillet over medium-high heat; cook, stirring constantly, until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer to small bowl and cool 5 minutes. Grind rice with spice grinder, mini food processor, or mortar and pestle until it resembles fine meal, 10 to 30 seconds (you should have about 1 tablespoon rice powder).\n\nBring broth to simmer in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork and cook, stirring frequently, until about half of pork is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon rice powder over pork; continue to cook, stirring constantly, until remaining pork is no longer pink, 1 to 1½ minutes longer. Transfer pork to large bowl; let cool 10 minutes.\n\nAdd remaining 1½ tablespoons fish sauce, remaining 2 teaspoons rice powder, shallots, lime juice, sugar, red pepper flakes, mint, and cilantro to pork; toss to combine. Serve with lettuce leaves.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "We prefer natural pork in this recipe. If using enhanced pork, skip the marinating in step 2 and reduce the amount of fish sauce to 2 tablespoons, adding it all in step 5. Dont skip the toasted rice; its integral to the texture and flavor of the dish. Any style of white rice can be used. Toasted rice powder (kao kua) can also be found in many Asian markets. This dish can be served with sticky rice and steamed vegetables as an entrée. To save time, prepare the other ingredients while the pork is in the freezer.",

    "name": "Moroccan Chicken with Olives and Lemon (Chicken Tagine)",
    "ingredients": "1 1/4 teaspoons sweet paprika\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/4 teaspoon ground coriander\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n3 strips lemon zest (each about 2 inches by 3/4 inch)\n3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, from 1 to 2 lemons\n5 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 5 teaspoons)\n1 whole chicken (3 1/2 to 4 pounds), cut into 8 pieces (4 breast pieces, 2 thighs, 2 drumsticks; wings reserved for another use) and trimmed of excess fat\nSalt and ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 large onion, halved and cut into 1/4-inch slices (about 3 cups)\n1 3/4 cups low-sodium chicken broth\n1 tablespoon honey\n2 medium carrots, peeled and cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick coins, very large pieces cut into half-moons (about 2 cups)\n1 cup Greek cracked green olives, pitted and halved\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro leaves",
    "directions": "Bone-in chicken parts can be substituted for the whole chicken. For best results, use four chicken thighs and two chicken breasts, each breast split in half; the dark meat contributes valuable flavor to the broth and should not be omitted. Use a vegetable peeler to remove wide strips of zest from the lemon before juicing it. Make sure to trim any white pith from the zest, as it can impart bitter flavor. If the olives are particularly salty, give them a rinse. Serve with couscous (see related recipe).\n\n1. Combine spices in small bowl and set aside. Mince 1 strip lemon zest; combine with 1 teaspoon minced garlic and mince together until reduced to fine paste; set aside.\n\n2. Season both sides of chicken pieces liberally with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large heavy--bottomed Dutch oven over medium-high heat until beginning to smoke. Brown chicken pieces skin side down in single layer until deep golden, about 5 minutes; using tongs, turn chicken pieces and brown on second side, about 4 minutes more. Transfer chicken to large plate; when cool enough to handle, peel off skin and discard. Pour off and discard all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot.\n\n3. Add onion and 2 remaining lemon zest strips to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have browned at edges but still retain shape, 5 to 7 minutes (add 1 tablespoon water if pan gets too dark). Add remaining 4 teaspoons garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add spices and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened and very fragrant, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Stir in broth and honey, scraping bottom of pot with wooden spoon to loosen browned bits. Add thighs and drumsticks, reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 5 minutes.\n\n4. Add carrots and breast pieces (with any accumulated juices) to pot, arranging breast pieces in single layer on top of carrots. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of breast registers 160 degrees, 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n5. Transfer chicken to plate or bowl and tent with foil. Add olives to pot; increase heat to medium-high and simmer until liquid has thickened slightly and carrots are tender, 4 to 6 minutes. Return chicken to pot and add garlic-zest mixture, cilantro, and lemon juice; stir to combine and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.\n\nTO MAKE AHEAD: The recipe can be prepared through step 4, cooled, and refrigerated for up to 2 days. To serve, gently warm until the chicken is heated through, then proceed with the recipe from step 5.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For the depth and flavor of an authentic tagine in about one hour, we developed a Moroccan chicken recipe that followed our standard braised chicken procedure: browning the skin-on pieces to give the braising liquid deep flavor; removing the chicken from the pot; sautéing onion, strips of lemon zest, garlic, and a spice blend (paprika, cumin, cayenne, ginger, coriander, and cinnamon) in a little oil; adding chicken broth and honey; and finally returning the chicken to the pot.

    "directions": "In a deep 12-inch stainless-steel skillet, melt butter over medium heat, stirring often, until melted, about 2 minutes. Once melted, continue to cook, stirring constantly, just until milk solids separate and sink to the bottom of the skillet and begin to darken, 2 to 3 minutes. (Butter can go from brown to burnt quickly, so keep a close eye on it as you stir it.) Add sage sprigs; cook, stirring constantly, until sage leaves darken and crisp and butter foams and browns, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nQuickly add carrots, apple cider, chicken or vegetable stock, honey, salt, and pepper to brown butter in skillet. Carrots should be almost submerged, if not, add a small amount of stock until they are. Bring to a boil over high heat, then cover, reduce heat to medium-high, and continue to boil, vigorously shaking the skillet occasionally, until carrots are a crisp/tender, and still firm in the center, about 8 minutes.\n\nReduce heat to medium, uncover (the liquid should look creamy and still almost cover the carrots) and continue to boil, vigorously stirring and shaking skillet often, until the mixture is reduced to a glaze that coats and clings to the carrots, 12 to 14 minutes. If the sauce begins to break and you see oily, butter-colored specks, add a splash of water (about 2 tablespoons) and return to a vigorous simmer, stirring constantly, until the mixture looks creamy and homogenous again.\n\nRemove from heat and discard sage sprigs. Stir in vinegar and season with salt to taste. Sprinkle with herbs. Serve immediately.",

Meanwhile, fill large bowl with ice water. Drain beans in colander and transfer beans immediately to ice water. When beans no longer feel warm to touch, drain in colander again and dry thoroughly with paper towels.\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons butter in small skillet over medium heat until foaming; add shallots and cook, stirring frequently, until golden brown, fragrant, and just crisp around the edges, about 10 minutes. Set skillet aside.\n\nHeat 1/4 cup water and beans in 12-inch skillet over high heat; cook, tossing frequently, until beans are warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste and arrange neatly on warm serving platter.\n\nMeanwhile, return skillet with shallots to high heat, stir in vermouth, and bring to simmer.

    "directions": "For the Soup: Using a broiler with the oven rack in the highest position, in a dry cast iron skillet over high heat, or over an open medium gas flame, char onion and ginger, using tongs to rotate for even charring, until softened and lightly blackened, about 10-12 minutes. Allow to cool, then peel the ginger and discard any heavily blackened parts and set aside.\n\nIn a medium cast iron or stainless steel skillet, toast cloves, star anise, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds over medium-low heat until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Let cool, then wrap cloves, star anise, coriander seeds, and fennel seeds in muslin and tie off with kitchen twine.\n\nWash all bones, shanks, tendons, and tripe thoroughly in water. Transfer beef leg and neck bones to a stockpot and add just enough water to cover. Bring to a boil over high hea, then let boil vigorously for 5 minutes to release foamy impurities.\n\nPour off water, then rinse bones to remove any remaining impurities. Wash stockpot thoroughly.\n\nReturn bones to stockpot along with shank and tendons to stockpot. Add cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, spice pouch, charred onion and ginger, salt, rock sugar, and 4 1/2 quarts (4.3L) water. Bring to a boil over high heat and skim off scum. Reduce heat to low and let simmer gently, uncovered, frequently skimming any scum and fat that floats to surface, for 3 hours.\n\nAdd tripe and simmer for 30 minutes. Add fish sauce and continue to simmer for 30 minutes longer.\n\nRemove shank, tendon, and tripe and shock them in a bowl filled with ice water to retain their texture. Drain and set aside.\n\nRemove broth from heat, then remove neck bones and bones with marrow and reserve for another use (I recommend eating it later as a snack). Let broth stand for 10 minutes to settle any sediment, then carefully strain broth through a mesh strainer lined with cheesecloth or muslin, being careful not to pour sediment through; you should have about 12 cups (2.8L) broth.\n\nReturn broth to a large clean pot, then taste and season with additional fish sauce and rock sugar to your liking. Set aside until ready to serve.\n\nTo Assemble and Serve: Slice shank, tendon, and tripe crosswise against the grain into thin slices. Set aside.\n\nArrange Thai basil, sawtooth herbs, bean sprouts, jalapeño slices, and lime wedges on a large plate.\n\nPlace sliced onion, scallion, and cilantro in separate bowls.\n\nCook noodles according to package instructions. Strain and rinse noodles with cold water.\n\nFor each serving, place about 4 ounces (115g) noodles in each bowl. Top with a few pieces of sliced shank, tendon, tripe, meatballs, and raw beef round. Garnish with sliced onion, scallion, and cilantro. Ladle about 1 1/2 cups hot broth into bowls and sprinkle with freshly ground pepper. Serve immediately with garnishes.",

    "notes": "See https://www.seriouseats.com/what-is-culantro for culantro image\nVietnamese meatballs can be found in the refrigerated section at the Asian grocery stores. Freeze leftover meatballs and defrost them in the fridge before cooking.\n\nIt is very difficult to slice beef so thinly at home; your best bet is to ask the butcher to do it for you, or to shop at an Asian grocer where you can find pre-sliced beef. If you do want to try slicing it yourself, freeze the beef until partially frozen (not rock-hard, but quite firm), then slice as thinly as possible with a very sharp slicing knife.",

    "directions": "1. Bring a large stockpot with water to boil over high heat. When it comes to a rolling boil, add the beef bones and boil vigourously for 10 minutes.\n\n2. In the meantime, heat a frying pan on medium-low heat. Add the Vietnamese Pho Spices and toast until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Dump the spices to the empty Crock Pot or slow cooker immediately. Return frying pan to medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil is hot, add the ginger slices and the onion half. Cook until the ginger is browned on both sides and the onion half is nicely browned and softened. Add the ginger and the onion to the Crock Pot or slow cooker.\n\n3. When the bones have been pre-boiled, drain, discard water and rinse bones briefly to clean them. Add the bones to the Crock Pot or slow cooker. Fill the Crock Pot with fresh, clean, cool water to just 1-1/2 inches below surface, add the fish sauce and sugar. Cover and set the Crock Pot or slow cooker to cook on low for 8 hours. Taste and season with additional fish sauce if needed.\n\n4. When you are just about ready to eat, you'll prep the rest of the ingredients for the Pho bowls. Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the beef balls and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes. Remove the balls, keeping the water boiling and now cook the noodles according to package instructions. If you are using fresh noodles, all they need is a couple of minutes. Drain immediately.\n\n5. Strain the stock with a fine meshed sieve. Discard the solids.\n\n6. Line up 4 large bowls on counter. Distribute the noodles, beef balls and thin steak slices evenly amongst the bowls. Ladle the hot Pho stock into each bowl. The hot stock should cook the thin steak slices. Serve with lime wedges, fresh herbs, chili peppers, Hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot chili sauce at the table.",

Heat butter in large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat; when foam subsides, whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, until nutty brown and fragrant, about 10 minutes; gradually and vigorously whisk in giblet broth and wine. Increase heat to medium-high and bring to boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened and flavorful, about 30 minutes; set aside until turkey is done.\n\n3. While turkey is resting on carving board, spoon out and discard as much fat as possible from roasting pan, then strain drippings into saucepan with gravy, pressing on solids in strainer to extract as much liquid as possible. Stir in reserved giblets; return to simmer to heat through. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper; serve with turkey.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: For our big turkey recipe, we wanted a Norman Rockwell picture of perfection: crisp, mahogany skin wrapped around tender, moist meat. It was difficult to find a container large enough for brining such a big bird. So we chose either a Butterball or a kosher turkey. Both have been, in essence, brined—the Butterball injected with a saltwater solution and the kosher bird packed in salt during koshering. Initial high heat gave our turkey a crisp skin, while lowering the heat for the remaining cooking time finished it off without drying it out. For such a showpiece, we wouldn’t think of serving store-bought gravy. We had plenty of time while the turkey cooked to prepare our tried-and-true giblet gravy recipe.",

    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Dust work surface with flour and unfold both pieces puff pastry onto work surface. Following illustrations below, form 1 large sheet with border, using beaten egg as directed. Sprinkle Parmesan evenly over shell; using fork, uniformly and thoroughly poke holes in shell. Bake 13 to 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees; continue to bake until golden brown and crisp, 13 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer to wire rack; increase oven temperature to 425 degrees.\n\nWhile shell bakes, place tomato slices in single layer on double layer paper towels and sprinkle evenly with 1/2 teaspoon salt; let stand 30 minutes. Place second double layer paper towels on top of tomatoes and press firmly to dry tomatoes. Combine garlic, olive oil, and pinch each salt and pepper in small bowl; set aside.\n\nSprinkle mozzarella evenly over warm (or cool, if made ahead) baked shell. Shingle tomato slices widthwise on top of cheese (about 4 slices per row); brush tomatoes with garlic oil. Bake until shell is deep golden brown and cheese is melted, 15 to 17 minutes. Cool on wire rack 5 minutes, sprinkle with basil, slide onto cutting board or serving platter, cut into pieces, and serve.",
    "description": "Tired of tomato tarts with soggy crusts and long preparation time, we developed a tomato tart recipe that would have a solid bottom crust and great vine-ripened flavor. Our secrets for a great tomato tart recipe? We used a two-step baking method for a flaky yet rigid crust, then \"waterproofed\" it with egg wash and layers of two kinds of cheese. We salted sliced tomatoes for 30 minutes to remove excess juice, then gently pressed them with paper towels. Baking the tart at 425 degrees quickly melted the cheese and preserved the tomatoes' meaty texture.",

    "directions": "If using a whole steak, trim and cut steak crosswise with grain into roughly 3-inch wide sections, then set on large plate and freeze until firm but not frozen solid, about 1 hour. If using pre-sliced steak, skip to chopping instructions in Step 2.\n\nUsing a sharp knife, shave steak as thin as possible on a biased angle against the grain. Mound shaved meat on cutting board and chop coarse with knife, about 5 times for store-bought sliced meat or 10 times for hand-sliced.\n\nHeat an empty 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Add oil to skillet and heat until just smoking. Add meat and onion in an even layer and cook, without stirring, until well browned on one side, 4 to 6 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring frequently to move and pull apart the meat slices until meat and onions are browned and meat is no longer pink, 2 to 4 minutes.\n\nStir in torn provolone cheese, Parmesan cheese (if using), salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, until cheese is melted and well combined, 1 to 2 minutes. Turn off heat. Divide mixture into 2 individual portions the length of the rolls. Shingle 2 slices of Provolone cheese over each portion. Cover and let cheese melt, about 1 minute.\n\nCenter rolls, cut sides down, over each portion of meat. Working with one at a time, use a large spatula to scoop under each portion of meat and flip meat into roll to create a filled sandwich. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "- Two options make perfectly thinly sliced beef possible: par freeze a steak to make hand-slicing much easier, or buy very thinly sliced meat from a butcher or Asian market.\n- Cooking the sliced beef with the onions saves time while guaranteeing the onions come out well browned while retaining a bit of bite.\n- Folding and melting a portion of the provolone cheese directly into the cooked steak adds flavor and acts as a binder to hold the thinly sliced meat together in the sandwich while eating.",

    "name": "Cast Iron Pan Pizza",
    "ingredients": "**Dough**\n2 cups (11 ounces) bread flour\n1 teaspoon table salt\n1 teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast\n1 cup (8 ounces) warm water (105 to 110 degrees)\nVegetable oil spray\n\n**Sauce**\n1 (14.5-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes\n1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil\n1 garlic clove, minced\n¼ teaspoon sugar\n¼ teaspoon table salt\n¼ teaspoon dried oregano\nPinch red pepper flakes\nPizza\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n4 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, shredded (1 cup)\n7 ounces whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded (1¾ cups)",
    "directions": "FOR THE DOUGH: Using wooden spoon or spatula, stir flour, salt, and yeast together in bowl. Add warm water and mix until most of flour is moistened. Using your hands, knead dough in bowl until dough forms sticky ball, about 1 minute. Spray 9-inch pie plate or cake pan with oil spray. Transfer dough to prepared plate and press into 7- to 8-inch disk. Spray top of dough with oil spray. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 12 to 24 hours.\n\nFOR THE SAUCE: Place tomatoes in fine-mesh strainer and crush with your hands. Drain well, then transfer to food processor. Add oil, garlic, sugar, salt, oregano, and pepper flakes and process until smooth, about 30 seconds. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.)\n\nFOR THE PIZZA: Two hours before baking, remove dough from refrigerator and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n\nCoat bottom of 12-inch cast-iron skillet with oil. Transfer dough to prepared skillet and use your fingertips to flatten dough until it is ⅛ inch from edge of skillet. Cover tightly with plastic and let rest until slightly puffy, about 1½ hours.\n\nThirty minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Spread ½ cup sauce evenly over top of dough, leaving ½-inch border (save remaining sauce for another use). Sprinkle Monterey Jack evenly over border. Press Monterey Jack into side of skillet, forming ½- to ¾-inch-tall wall. (Not all cheese will stick to side of skillet.) Evenly sprinkle mozzarella over sauce. Bake until cheese at edge of skillet is well browned, 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nTransfer skillet to stovetop and let sit until sizzling stops, about 3 minutes. Run butter knife around rim of skillet to loosen pizza. Using thin metal spatula, gently lift edge of pizza and peek at underside to assess browning. Cook pizza over medium heat until bottom crust is well browned, 2 to 5 minutes (skillet handle will be hot). Using 2 spatulas, transfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes. Slice and serve.",

Drain excess moisture from meat. Return meat to skillet (discard any liquid in bowl) and add salt and pepper. Heat, stirring constantly, until meat is warmed through, 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat to low, sprinkle with Parmesan, and shingle slices of American cheese over meat. Allow cheeses to melt, about 2 minutes. Using heatproof spatula or wooden spoon, fold melted cheese into meat thoroughly. Divide mixture evenly among toasted rolls. Serve immediately.",

    "ingredients": "1 head garlic (2 to 2 1/2 ounces; 60g)\n1/4 cup (60g) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, divided, plus more for serving\n2 1/4 pounds(1kg) yellow, medium starch potatoes such as Yukon Gold (about eight 5-ounce potatoes), scrubbed\n1/2 cup (120ml) heavy whipping cream, plus for as needed\n2 teaspoons (6g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight\nFreshly ground black pepper, for serving",
    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400°F (205°C). Remove the outer layer of papery skin from the garlic head, making sure to leave the entire head intact. Slice about 1/4 inch off the tops of the garlic head so the cloves are all exposed. Place garlic head on a piece of aluminum foil large enough to wrap the garlic, and set 1 piece of butter on top of the cut side; enclose it with the foil.\n\nUsing a paring knife, score potato skins lengthwise around the middle of each potato. Arrange potatoes on a rimmed baking sheet and cover sheet tightly with aluminum foil. Place wrapped garlic directly on oven rack; Bake potatoes and garlic until potatoes are fork-tender and garlic is deep golden and soft, about 1 hour. Set garlic aside to cool slightly while preparing the potatoes. Let potatoes stand until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.\n\nWhile potatoes are still hot, carefully remove the skins using a paring knife; discard skins. Set a ricer or food mill over a large bowl and pass potatoes through. Alternatively, transfer potatoes to a large bowl and mash with potato masher, being careful not to overwork. Add remaining butter pieces and squeeze roasted garlic cloves (discarding skins) into potatoes; mash mixture with a large fork or potato masher until well combined.\n\nMicrowave heavy cream until steaming, about 30 seconds. Slowly add warm heavy cream and salt, folding into potatoes until creamy and smooth. Adjust consistency with additional warmed heavy cream as needed to desired texture. Season to taste with more salt and pepper, if desired. Serve immediately with pats of butter on top.",

Cool until handleable, then pull the stem(s) off the chile(s) and roughly chop. Peel the skin off the garlic. Scoop into a food processor and pulse until quite finely chopped.\n\nAdd the tomatoes with their juice. Re-cover and pulse until you have a coarse puree. Scrape into a serving dish. Stir in the black olives, cilantro and the fruit (plus any liquid). If necessary, add a little water to give the salsa an easily spoonable consistency. Taste and season with salt, usually about 1/2 teaspoon. You’re ready to serve.",

    "directions": "01 Heat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. In a large Dutch oven, toss the beef with 1 tablespoon salt and 2 teaspoons pepper. Add ½ the carrots, the anchovies, oil, garlic and onion, then toss. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook for 2 hours.\n\n02 Remove the pot from the oven and stir in ½ cup of the olives. Return to the oven uncovered and cook until a knife inserted into a piece of beef meets no resistance, 1 to 1½ hours.\n\n03 Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a large bowl, leaving the vegetables in the pot. Set a fine mesh strainer over a fat separator or medium bowl. Pour the meat juices into the strainer, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids. You should have about 2½ cups liquid; if needed, add water to make up the difference.\n\n04 Pour the wine into the now-empty pot and bring to a boil over medium-high, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the wine is reduced by half, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, if you strained the meat juices into a bowl, use a spoon to skim off and discard the fat from the surface.\n\n05 Pour the defatted meat juices into the pot and add the remaining carrots and the bell pepper. Return to a simmer and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the sauce is slightly thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the orange juice and beef. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce begins to cling to the meat, 3 to 6minutes.\n\n06 Off heat, stir in the remaining ½ cup olives, the orange zest, vinegar and half of the parsley. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle with the remaining parsley.",

    "notes": "Use a light hand when seasoning with kosher salt, as the cheese itself is rather salty. Cooling the quesadillas before cutting and serving is important; straight from the skillet, the cheese is molten and will ooze out.

Finished quesadillas can be held on a baking sheet in a 200-degree oven for up to 20 minutes",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Roast chicken is often described as a simple dish, and it is, at least in terms of flavor—when the dish is made properly, the rich flavor and juicy meat of the chicken need little adornment. But the actual process of preparing and roasting chicken is anything but simple; recipes often call for complicated trussing techniques and for rotating the bird multiple times during cooking. And the most time-consuming part is salting or brining the bird, a step that ensures juiciness and well-seasoned meat. After systematically testing the various components and steps of a typical recipe, we found we could just tie the legs together and tuck the wings underneath. We also discovered we could skip both the V-rack and flipping the chicken by using a preheated skillet and placing the chicken breast side up; this method gave the thighs a jump-start on cooking. Starting the chicken in a 450-degree oven and then turning the oven off while the chicken finished cooking slowed the evaporation of juices, ensuring moist, tender meat.",

Remove the chicken to a platter, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes while you prepare the sauce, leaving the lemons and onions in the pan.\n\nPlace the pan on top of the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the wine and stir with a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits. Add the stock and sprinkle on the flour, stirring constantly for a minute, until the sauce thickens. Add any juices that collect under the chicken. Carve the chicken onto a platter and serve with the lemons, onions, and warm sauce.",

Transfer to ice bath to chill.\n\nFill a second large bowl with ice water. In the same saucepan, bring 3 quarts (2.8L) water to a boil. Carefully lower eggs in and continue to boil for 30 seconds. Cover tightly, reduce heat to low (water should maintain a bare simmer), and continue cooking for 11 minutes. Immediately place eggs in second bowl of ice water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before peeling under cool running water.\n\nMeanwhile, in the bowl of a food processor, place mayonnaise, sour cream, basil, dill, lemon juice, mustard, anchovy fillet, pepper, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and process until smooth, scraping down sides of bowl as needed, about 1 minute. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in chives and tarragon.\n\nTransfer haricot verts to a paper towel-lined plate and pat dry. Cut eggs into quarters and transfer to small plate or bowl and cover and refrigerate until ready to serve salad.\n\nIn a large bowl, combine fennel, potatoes, haricot verts, and green goddess dressing. Stir with rubber spatula to combine. Fold in potatoes. Season with salt to taste. Cover and rest in fridge for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days before serving. To serve, transfer potato salad to serving bowl and decoratively arrange quartered eggs on top. Garnish with basil, dill, and chives.\n\nSerious Eats/ Stacy Allen\n\nThe salad can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Cooked eggs can be stored separately in an airtight container for up to 5 days.",

    "notes": "**TECHNIQUE\n\nThe Benefits of Overcooking Waxy Potatoes**\nThe rules for cooking potatoes seem pretty straightforward: Undercook them and they’ll stay intact; overcook them and they’ll break down into crumbly bits. But while developing our Braised Red Potatoes recipe, we allowed a batch of halved red potatoes to simmer for 35 minutes (by which point I expected them to be overcooked) and noticed that they not only stayed intact but actually cooked up incredibly creamy and smooth. Had we been wrong about the effects of overcooking potatoes in general, or was there something different about the low-starch red kind?\n\n**EXPERIMENT\n**\nWe prepared two batches of my working recipe, one with low-starch red potatoes and another with high-starch russets (quartering these larger spuds) and simmering each for 35 minutes.\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nJust as they had before, the red potatoes held their shape and boasted remarkably silky interiors. The russets, however, broke down and turned crumbly and mushy.\n\n**EXPLANATION**\n\nA little-known but key difference between waxy potatoes (red or new potatoes) and starchy potatoes (russets) is that they contain different ratios of two different starches: amylopectin and amylose. Waxy potatoes contain very little amylose; as they cook, the starch granules in waxy potatoes burst, releasing very sticky amylopectin, which in essence glues the potato structure together, giving the impression of creaminess. In a russet or other starchy potato, there is a higher ratio of the second starch—amylose—which is made up of smaller molecules that are less sticky. Despite the fact that, overall, russets contain more starch than do waxy potatoes (hence they are often described as being “high starch”), russets simply fall apart once overcooked since most of the starch is the less sticky amylose.\n\n",

    "directions": "Combine the milk and cornstarch in a medium bowl. Using a fork, whisk until the cornstarch is completely dissolved and no lumps remain. Whisk in the eggs, salt, and dill.\n\nIn a medium nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. When the butter starts to bubble, add the egg mixture. Let it set around the edges, about 30 seconds. Using a rubber spatula, pull the edges inward, letting the runny eggs spill toward the edges of the pan. Let cook for 30 seconds cooking, more, then pull the set edges to the center again. Continue stirring constantly, until the eggs look soft and slightly under-cooked, 60 to 90 seconds more (they will continue to cook, so best not to wait until they are fully cooked to take them off the heat). Remove from the heat and transfer the eggs to a platter. Sprinkle the chives over the top and serve.",

    "directions": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\nAlthough this dish goes together quickly, you can prepare the topping and blanch the cauliflower (steps 1 and 2) an hour or two in advance. Don’t prepare the sauce or bake the gratin until just before serving.\n\n**For the topping:** Pulse bread, butter, salt, and pepper in food processor until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about ten 1-second pulses; set aside.\n\n**For the filling:** Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 450 degrees. Bring 4 quarts water to boil in Dutch oven or stockpot over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon salt and cauliflower; cook until outsides are tender but insides are still slightly crunchy, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain cauliflower in colander and rinse under cold running tap water until no longer hot. Leave cauliflower in colander to drain.\n\nHeat butter in large skillet over medium heat; when foam subsides, add shallot and cook until softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds; stir in flour until combined, about 1 minute. Whisk in cream and bring to boil. Stir in nutmeg, cayenne, 1/4 teaspoon salt, pepper, thyme, and 1/2 cup cheese until incorporated. Off heat, gently stir in cauliflower until evenly combined. Transfer mixture to 11 by 7-inch (2-quart) gratin dish. Sprinkle remaining 2 tablespoons cheese evenly over surface, then sprinkle evenly with bread crumb topping. Bake until golden brown and sauce is bubbling around edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve immediately.",

    "directions": "**FOR THE LEVAIN:** Combine flour, water, and starter in small bowl and stir with wooden spoon until uniform. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit until doubled in volume, 3 to 5 hours. Use immediately or transfer to refrigerator and use within 7 days.\n\n**FOR THE DOUGH:** Whisk flour and salt together in medium bowl. In large bowl, combine water and 57 grams levain (discard remainder), and whisk until smooth. Add flour mixture to water mixture and stir using wooden spoon, scraping up dry flour from bottom of bowl until dough comes together, then knead by hand in bowl until shaggy ball forms and no dry flour remains. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature until subtly domed, lightly bubbly, and just doubled in volume, 6-12 hours.\n\nTransfer dough to lightly floured counter. Gently press dough into 8- to 10-inch disk, then fold edges toward middle to form round*. Cover loosely with plastic and let rest for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, line colander or banneton with large linen or cotton dish towel and dust liberally with flour. Repeat pressing and folding of dough to form round, then place dough seam side down on counter and form into tight round.  **Place dough seam side up in floured banneton (or towel in colander)**. Cover top of dough loosely with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour, then refrigerate for 24-36 hours (whatever is most convenient).\n\nOne hour before baking bread, adjust oven rack to middle position, set covered heavy-bottomed Dutch oven on rack, and heat oven to 475 degrees.\n\nOnce oven has preheated for 1 hour, lay 12- by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper on counter and spray generously with vegetable oil spray. Uncover colander, and unfold edges of towel. Lay parchment sprayed side down over loaf, then invert colander onto counter. Remove colander and towel.\n\nCarefully remove Dutch oven from oven, place on stovetop, and set lid aside. Using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 7-inch-long, 1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Pick up dough by lifting parchment edges and lower into Dutch oven. Carefully cover pot and transfer to oven. Bake for 20 minutes.\n\nRemove lid, reduce oven temperature to 425 degrees, and continue to bake until loaf is deep brown and registers 210 degrees, 25 to 35 minutes longer. Carefully remove bread from pot; transfer to wire rack and let cool completely before slicing, 2 to 3 hours. (Store uneaten bread cut side down on cutting board for up to 3 days.)",

    "notes": "2025-06-26 - Tried 100 gm of Levain, 350 gm water\n2025-05-10 - Need more tanginess. Dropping first bulk fermentation rise to 6-12 hours from 12-18 (just doubled). Extending the 2nd rise in the fridge from 12-24 to 24-36 hour.\nTry using more levain (about 15% to flour ratio) - adjust 57 g to 77 g levain\nWill also try using **wheat flour** for levain \n\n2025-05-08 - Made. Much easier than expected. \nAdjusting cook time after removing lid from 15 to 30 minutes at 425º. Trust the 210º bread temp. It needed to get that to get to darkness.\n[photo:1]\n\n*To round, set dough on unfloured counter. Loosely cup your hands around dough and, without applying pressure to dough, move your hands in small circular motions. Tackiness of dough against counter and circular motion should work dough into smooth, even ball, but if dough sticks to your hands, lightly dust your fingers with flour.",

Add butter, cream, orange juice, salt, cinnamon, remaining 1/2 teaspoon orange zest, pepper, and cayenne and process until completely smooth, 30 to 60 seconds, scraping down bowl as needed.\n\nTransfer potato puree to 2-quart soufflé dish and sprinkle evenly with reserved sugar-zest mixture. Broil sweet potatoes until topping is lightly browned and bubbling, 2 to 4 minutes. Serve.\n\n**TO MAKE AHEAD:** Processed potatoes can be refrigerated without topping for up to 2 days. To serve, cover dish with aluminum foil and bake on middle rack of 400-degree oven until hot throughout, 30 to 40 minutes. Remove foil, add brown sugar topping, and broil as directed in step 4.",

Remove from the heat and stir in the soy sauce. If necessary, add some water, a little at a time, until the salsa is the consistency of runny ketchup. Cool, taste and season with salt—it may not need any, depending on the saltiness of your soy sauce but keep in mind that Salsa Negra should be seasoned highly, both to preserve it for longer storage and to make it useful as a seasoning.  Transfer the salsa to a pint-size jar and store, covered, in the refrigerator, where it will last for a month or two.",

Cover and cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting heat as necessary to maintain vigorous simmer, until pork is tender and fork inserted into meat meets little resistance, about 1 hour.\n\nOff heat, use slotted spoon to transfer pork to bowl. Pour liquid into fat separator and let settle for 5 minutes; discard solids. Return defatted liquid to pot and cook over medium heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 15 minutes. Stir in pork, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve. (Braised pork belly can be refrigerated for up to 2 days. To reheat, cook over low heat in covered Dutch oven until warmed through.)\n\nFOR THE SEASONED DAIKON: Toss daikon, sugar, and salt together in bowl. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. (Daikon can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)\n\nFOR THE HOISIN-SOY SAUCE: Combine hoisin and soy sauces in small bowl.\n\nFOR THE BAO: Using stand mixer fitted with dough hook, mix flour, sugar, yeast, baking powder, and salt on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add milk and shortening and continue to mix until no dry flour remains and dough has formed ball around hook, about 2 minutes longer. Increase speed to medium-low and knead until dough is smooth and pulls away from sides of bowl, 5 minutes.\n\nTransfer dough to counter and knead briefly to form smooth ball. Grease medium bowl with ¼ teaspoon oil. Place dough in bowl and roll in oil to coat. Arrange dough in bowl seam side down and cover. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.\n\nWhile dough rises, cut sixteen 4-inch squares of parchment paper. Divide squares evenly between 2 rimmed baking sheets (8 squares per sheet). Place remaining 2 tablespoons oil in small bowl.\n\nTransfer dough to counter. Press dough gently but firmly to expel all air. Knead briefly to form smooth ball. Using bench scraper or chef's knife, cut dough in half. Return half of dough to bowl and cover.\n\nRoll remaining dough into 8-inch log. Cut log into 8 equal portions (about 1⅓ ounces each) and cover. Using your fingertips, pat 1 portion to ¼-inch-thick disk (keep remaining portions covered). Fold edges toward center and pinch to form ball. Turn ball pinched side down and round to form smooth sphere. Cover and repeat with remaining 7 portions.\n\nRoll 1 dough ball into 6-inch oval. Transfer to small cutting board or plate and brush lightly with oil. Lightly brush chopstick with oil and lay it horizontally across center of oval. Fold oval in half over chopstick to form bun. Using chopstick, lift dough (it should drape evenly over both sides) and transfer to parchment square. Gently pull out chopstick, leaving bun folded. Repeat with remaining dough balls. Cover buns and let rise until slightly puffy, about 30 minutes. Repeat steps 11 and 12 with remaining dough, placing buns on second prepared sheet.\n\nMeanwhile, bring 4 cups water to boil in 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or 12-inch skillet. Arrange first batch of buns, on parchment squares, in two 10-inch bamboo steamer baskets (4 buns per basket). Stack baskets and cover. Reduce heat to maintain simmer and set steamer in wok. Steam buns for 10 minutes (do not uncover, as buns might collapse; small wisps of steam should escape from beneath lid during cooking). Off heat, remove steamer from wok and let rest, covered, for 5 minutes. Transfer buns, still on parchment, to wire rack. Steam remaining buns.\n\nTo serve, place slice of pork inside bun. Garnish with seasoned daikon; hoisin-soy sauce; cilantro; scallions; peanuts; and Thai chiles, if using. Serve immediately.\n\nSTORAGE AND REHEATING: Bao can be kept covered at room temperature for up to 3 hours or refrigerated for up to 3 days. To serve, resteam (on parchment squares) for 2 to 3 minutes. Alternatively, bao can be frozen for up to 1 month. Arrange cooled bao (on parchment squares) in zipper-lock bag. To serve, steam from frozen (on parchment squares) until warmed through, 7 to 8 minutes.",

    "directions": "For the first 5 minutes of cooking, the cauliflower steams in its own released moisture, so it is important not to lift the lid from the skillet during this time.\n\n1. Trim outer leaves of cauliflower and cut stem flush with bottom of head. Turn head so stem is facing down and cut head into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Cut around core to remove florets; discard core. Cut large florets into 1 1/2-inch pieces. Transfer florets to bowl, including any small pieces that may have been created during trimming, and set aside.\n\n2. Heat cumin seeds and coriander seeds in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted and fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to spice grinder or mortar and pestle and coarsely grind. Wipe out skillet.\n\n3. Combine 2 tablespoons oil and cauliflower florets in now-empty skillet and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper. Cover skillet and cook over medium-high heat until florets start to brown and edges just start to become translucent (do not lift lid), about 5 minutes.\n\n4. Remove lid and continue to cook, stirring every 2 minutes, until florets turn golden brown in many spots, about 12 minutes.\n\n5. Push cauliflower to edges of skillet. Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil, paprika, cayenne, cumin-coriander mixture, and lime zest to center and cook, stirring with rubber spatula, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir spice mixture into cauliflower and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until cauliflower is tender but still firm, about 3 minutes longer.\n\n6. Remove skillet from heat and stir in mint. Transfer cauliflower to serving platter and sprinkle with pistachios. Serve, passing lime wedges separately.",

    "ingredients": "1 whole chicken small, (about 3 lbs), trimmed of excess fat, giblets removed and discarded, chicken rinsed and patted dry\nTable salt and ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil plus 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil\n3 cloves garlic, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)\n1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves\n⅛ teaspoon red pepper flakes\n2 tablespoons lemon juice from 1 lemon, plus 1 lemon cut into wedges\n1 ½ pounds Red Bliss potatoes (small), scrubbed, dried, and cut into 3/4 inch pieces\n1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley leaves",
    "directions": "TECHNIQUE: BUTTERFLYING A CHICKEN With the breast side down and the tail of the chicken facing you, use poultry shears to cut along the length of one side of the backbone. With breast side still down, turn the neck end to face you, cut along the other side of the backbone and remove it. Turn the chicken breast-side up. Open the chicken on the work surface. Use the palm of your hand to flatten the chicken, then pound it with the flat side of a mallet to a fairly even thickness. Season the chicken with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nAdjust an oven rack to the lowest position and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Heat 1 teaspoon of the oil in a heavy-bottomed 12-inch ovenproof nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to smoke. Swirl the skillet to coat evenly with oil. Place the chicken, skin-side down, in the hot pan and reduce the heat to medium. Place the weight (see the note above) on the chicken and cook, checking every 5 minutes or so, until evenly browned, about 25 minutes. (After 20 minutes, the chicken should be fairly crisp and golden; if not, turn the heat up to medium-high and continue to cook until well browned.)\n\nMeanwhile, mix the remaining 2 tablespoons oil, garlic, 1½ teaspoons of the thyme, the pepper flakes, lemon juice, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl and set aside.\n\nUsing tongs, carefully transfer the chicken, skin-side up, to a clean plate. Pour off any accumulated fat in the pan and add the potatoes, sprinkling them with ¼ teaspoon salt, 1/8 teaspoon black pepper, and the remaining 1½ teaspoons thyme. Place the chicken, skin-side up, on the potatoes and brush the skin with the reserved thyme-lemon juice mixture.\n\nTransfer the pan to the oven and roast until the thickest part of the breast registers 160 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 10 to 15 minutes longer. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest 10 to 15 minutes.\n\nReturn the skillet with the potatoes to the oven and roast until browned and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to a large bowl, leaving the fat behind. Toss the potatoes with the parsley. Cut the chicken into pieces. Serve the chicken and potatoes immediately with the lemon wedges.\n\nLike this recipe? Share it, or leave a comment below.",

    "description": null,
    "notes": "It pays to use a high-quality ricotta rather than a watery supermarket brand. Look for fresh, creamy (not curdy) ricotta at an Italian grocer, gourmet market, or specialty cheese shop. This dish calls for a lot of black pepper, but the heat works well with the mild, creamy cheese. You can use penne in place of the shells.",

    "directions": "Combine stock, tomato paste, anchovies, gelatin, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in a blender and blend on high speed until homogenous. Set aside.\n\nAdjust oven rack to lowest position and preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season beef all over with salt and pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet or large plate and set aside.\n\nAdd mushrooms to Dutch oven and cook, stirring, until liquid is released and mushrooms begin to brown, about 6 minutes, lowering heat as necessary to prevent scorching. Add diced carrots and pearl onions and cook, stirring, until well-browned on all sides. Season to taste with salt and pepper, transfer to a bowl, and set aside.\n\nAdd halved yellow onion to Dutch oven, cut-side-down. Add whole carrots, celery stalks, and garlic. Cook, turning carrots, celery, and garlic occasionally until all the vegetables are well-browned, about 4 minutes.\n\nAdd wine or sherry, scrape up browned bits with a wooden spoon, and cook until reduced by 3/4, about 3 minutes. Add broth mixture and bring to a simmer. Remove from heat.\n\nCut seared steaks into 1 1/2- to 2-inch chunks and transfer to a large bowl. Toss with flour. Add beef and any juices accumulated in the tray or plate to the Dutch oven along with bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Stir to combine and return to a simmer over medium heat. Transfer to oven, cover **with lid partially open**, and cook until beef is starting to become tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Liquid should hold a slow, steady simmer the entire time. Adjust oven temperature if necessary during cooking. 180 to 190°F is the ideal range\n\nRemove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard carrot, celery, thyme, bay leaves, onion, and garlic. Add potatoes and reserved sautéed mushrooms, pearl onions, and carrots to stew, return to oven, and continue to cook, partially covered, until beef, potatoes, and carrots are tender and broth has thickened, 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n\nRemove stew from oven. If necessary, place over a burner and simmer for up to 15 minutes to reduce to desired consistency. Stir in peas. Season to taste with salt and pepper if necessary. Serve immediately, or refrigerate overnight or for up to 5 days and reheat to serve.",

    "directions": "Puree all marinade ingredients in blender until smooth, scraping down blender jar as needed.\n\nPlace steak on rimmed baking sheet or in large baking dish. Using dinner fork, prick steak about 20 times on each side. Rub both sides of steak evenly with salt and then with paste. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.\n\nUsing large chimney starter, ignite about 6 quarts (1 large chimney, or 2 1/2 pounds) charcoal briquettes and burn until covered with thin coating of light gray ash, about 20 minutes. Empty coals into grill; build two-level fire by arranging coals to cover one half of grill. Position grill grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate for 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush. Grill is ready when coals are hot (you can hold your hand 5 inches above grate for just 2 seconds).\n\nUsing paper towels, wipe paste off steak; season both sides with pepper. Grill steak directly over coals until well browned, 4 to 6 minutes. Using tongs, flip steak; grill until second side is well browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using paring knife, make small cut into thickest part of meat; if meat is slightly less done than desired, transfer steak to cutting board (meat will continue to cook as it rests). If steak is significantly underdone, position so that thinner side is over cool side of grill and thicker side is over hot side; continue to cook until thickest part is slightly less done than desired, then transfer steak to cutting board.\n\nLoosely tent steak with foil; let rest 5 to 10 minutes. Using sharp chef's knife or carving knife, slice steak about 1/4 inch thick against grain and on bias. Serve immediately.",

    "description": "Mushroom duxelles (pronounced duck-SELL) is an intensely flavored combination of finely chopped mushrooms, shallots, and fresh herbs such as thyme or parsley that are slowly cooked to a paste-like consistency. French in origin and named after the marquis d'Uxelles, this mushroom condiment is traditionally used in the preparation of beef Wellington, but it can also be used to flavor soups and sauces as well as to fill omelets and ravioli. It also happens to make for a delectable spread on crostini or toast points. Other creative uses include adding it as a flavor booster for mashed potatoes or mushroom-centric pasta dishes. \n\n The key ingredients in duxelles are mushrooms, butter, salt, and pepper. Any type of mushroom or a combination can be used, including cremini, morel, shiitake, porcini, and white button mushrooms, and ingredient variations can include shallots and/or garlic and chopped fresh parsley.\n\nAn important step in making duxelles is to remove as much moisture as possible from the mushrooms, both before cooking and during the process. They need to be cooked long enough so the mushrooms release their moisture and then cook completely until the liquid evaporates. This will prevent any unnecessary sogginess, which is essential to a crisp pastry for beef Wellington. ",

    "ingredients": "Vegetable oil for grill rack\n4 tablespoons Olive Oil\n9 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 3 tablespoons)\n1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary\nKosher Salt\n2 pounds Red Bliss potatoes (about 18), scrubbed, halved, and skewered according to illustration below (see note above)\nGround Black Pepper\nLarge disposable aluminum baking pan (13 by 9-inch)\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh chives",
    "directions": "This recipe allows you to grill an entree while the hot coals burn down in step 1. Once that item is done, start grilling the potatoes. This recipe works best with small potatoes that are about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. If using medium potatoes, 2 to 3 inches in diameter, cut potatoes into quarters. If potatoes are larger than 3 inches in diameter, cut each potato into eighths. Since potatoes are cooked in microwave, use wooden skewers.\n\n1. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal (6 quarts, or about 100 briquettes) and allow to burn until coals are fully ignited and covered with thin layer of ash, about 20 minutes. Empty coals into grill; build two-level fire by arranging two-thirds of coals over half of grill and arranging remaining coals in single layer over other half. Position cooking grate over coals, cover grill, and heat grate until hot, about 5 minutes; scrape grate clean with grill brush. Remove lid and let coals burn until fire on hotter part of grill is medium (you can hold your hand 5 inches above grate for 5 to 6 seconds), about 10 minutes. Dip wad of paper towels in vegetable oil; holding wad with tongs, wipe cooking grate.\n\n2. Meanwhile, heat olive oil, garlic, rosemary, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in small skillet over medium heat until sizzling, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until garlic is light blond, about 3 minutes. Pour mixture through fine-mesh strainer into small bowl; press on solids. Measure 1 tablespoon solids and 1 tablespoon oil into large bowl and set aside. Discard remaining solids but reserve remaining oil.\n\n3. Place skewered potatoes in single layer on large microwave-safe plate and poke each potato several times with skewer. Brush with 1 tablespoon strained oil and season liberally with salt. Microwave on high power until potatoes offer slight resistance when pierced with tip of paring knife, about 8 minutes, turning them halfway through cooking time. Transfer potatoes to baking sheet coated with 1 tablespoon strained oil. Brush with remaining tablespoon strained oil; season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\n4. Place potatoes on hotter side of grill. Cook, turning once, until grill marks appear, about 4 minutes. Move potatoes to cooler side of grill; cover with disposable pan and continue to cook until paring knife slips in and out of potatoes easily, 5 to 8 minutes longer. Remove potatoes from skewers and transfer to bowl with reserved garlic/oil mixture; add chives and toss until thoroughly coated. Serve immediately.\n\nTECHNIQUE\n\nSkewering Potatoes For the Grill\n\nPlace potato half cut-side down on work surface and pierce through center with skewer. Repeat, holding already-skewered potatoes for better leverage.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nFor potent garlic flavor in our grilled potato recipe, without bitterness or charring, we needed to introduce the potatoes to the garlic-oil mixture not once but three times.

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nFor a vegetarian bean chili recipe that was rich and highly flavorful, with a nice, sharp heat as well as some gentle sweetness, we narrowed down a list of eight initial contenders to three beans with an earthy flavor and firm texture—red kidney, pinto, and black. To season our vegetarian bean chili recipe we decided to add a sweet red pepper to our base of onions and garlic. Chili powder, along with whole cumin seeds and a little cayenne, provided the depth and heat we sought. For the liquid, we decided to stick with water and the customary tomatoes.",

Using 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil, cook the remaining tofu in the same way and transfer to the plate.\n\n03 In the same skillet, combine the remaining 1 teaspoon oil, the garlic, chili and scallion whites; cook over medium, stirring, until the garlic is fragrant and lightly browned, about 1 minute. Stir in the scallion greens, then return the tofu to the skillet and gently toss to combine. Transfer to a platter, scraping the bits from the pan onto the tofu.",
    "description": "Instead of deep-frying, a common cooking technique to make Chinese salt and pepper tofu, we coat the pieces of tofu with seasoned cornstarch, then pan-fry them in batches to brown and crisp the exteriors. In the empty skillet, a punchy mix of garlic, fresh chili and scallions is quickly cooked, and the tofu is tossed back in. The finished dish is sauceless but incredibly flavorful from the savory bits that cling to the tofu’s crisped surfaces.",

    "name": "These Crispy Smashed Potatoes Are a Hot Mess—and That's the Point",
    "ingredients": "For the Potatoes:\n2 pounds (900 g) small yellow or gold potatoes (see notes)\nKosher salt\n3 or 4 sprigs fresh thyme\nExtra-virgin olive oil, for pan-frying\nFor the Tonnato Sauce:\n1 large egg\n1/4 cup (60 ml) fresh lemon juice (from 2 whole lemons), divided\n2 anchovy fillets (about 1/4 ounce; 7 g)\n1 teaspoon (5 ml) Dijon mustard\n1 teaspoon (5 g) drained capers\n1/2 cup (120 ml) vegetable oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml) extra-virgin olive oil\n4 ounces (113 g) oil-packed tuna, drained\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\nFor the Parsley Sauce:\n1 ounce (30 g) flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems\n1/2 cup (120 ml) extra-virgin olive oil\nKosher salt\nFor Serving:\n1/4 cup pitted olives, such as Taggiasca or Gaeta (see notes)\nAbout 2 tablespoons drained and minced Quick-Pickled Red Onion\nAbout 2 tablespoons chopped Calabrian chiles in oil or other jarred chiles in oil (see notes)",
    "directions": "For the Potatoes: In a large pot, cover potatoes with cold water, season heavily with salt, and add thyme. Bring to a boil over high heat , then reduce heat to a gentle simmer and cook until potatoes are completely tender, about 10 minutes after a boil is achieved (poke a potato with a sharp knife or cake tester to test for doneness). Drain in a colander set in the sink and let rest for 10 minutes to dry and cool slightly.\n\nWorking with one potato at a time, place potato on cutting board and smash firmly with the bottom of a heavy skillet to a thickness of about 1/2 inch. Transfer to a large plate or tray as you work.\n\nIn a large nonstick or cast iron skillet, heat about 1/4 inch of olive oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add as many potatoes as will fit in a single layer. Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until bottom side is deep golden brown, about 6 minutes. Carefully flip with a thin metal spatula and cook until second side is golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and allow to drain.\n\nContinue cooking potatoes in batches, adding more oil as necessary, until all potatoes are cooked. Potatoes can then be left aside until ready to serve.\n\nWhile the potatoes are boiling, make the Tonnato Sauce: Place egg, 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice, anchovies, mustard, and capers in a blender or food processor and, with the processor or blender running, slowly drizzle in vegetable oil followed by the olive oil until oil is fully emulsified and a mayonnaise has formed.\n\nTurn off processor or blender and scrape down sides of cup using a rubber spatula, then add tuna and remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) lemon juice. Process or blend just until tuna is thoroughly incorporated into a smooth sauce, 15 to 30 seconds. Avoid over-blending, as this can cause the sauce to become grainy. Transfer tonnato sauce to a medium bowl and season with salt and pepper. Rinse out processor or blender jar.\n\nFor the Parsley Sauce: In the rinsed processor or blender, combine parsley with oil and blend until a fairly smooth sauce forms. Season with salt.\n\nTo Serve: On a large platter, spread a generous layer of tonnato sauce all over. Arrange potatoes on top (if they've cooled and you want to serve them warm, you can reheat them in a 400°F oven for about 6 minutes). Spoon some generous spoonfuls of parsley sauce on top along with a scattering of the olives, minced pickled onions, and chiles in oil. Serve. (Note, you will have leftovers of the sauces.)\n\nThe potatoes can be boiled and then cooled and refrigerated up to 2 days in advance. Once smashed and pan-fried, they can be held for a couple hours before reheating in a hot oven and serving.\n\nThe tonnato sauce and parsley oil can be refrigerated in airtight containers for up to 3 days.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Any small, creamy potato can work here, including Yukon Golds, yellow potatoes, red potatoes, and more.\n\nFeel free to substitute any chile-oil-type product or oily chile paste in place of the Calabrian chiles called for here; this recipe is flexible and can handle many substitutions.\n\nYou will have extra of the sauces. Save them for whatever you want—spoon them onto other vegetable dishes, roast chicken, fish, pork, or other meats, use them in sandwiches and salads, and more.",

    "ingredients": "4 ½ teaspoons salt\n1 tablespoon sugar\n12 ounces shell-on jumbo shrimp (16 to 20 per pound), peeled, deveined, and tails removed, shells reserved\n4 ½ teaspoons Extra-virgin Olive Oil\n½ cup dry white wine\n2 sprigs fresh thyme\n4 ½ teaspoons lemon juice, plus lemon wedges for serving\n½ teaspoon cornstarch\n4 garlic cloves, sliced thin\n¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes\n⅛ teaspoon Pepper\n2 tablespoons Unsalted Butter, cut into ½-inch pieces\n1 ½ teaspoons chopped fresh parsley",
    "directions": "Extra-large shrimp (21 to 25 per pound) can be substituted for jumbo shrimp. If you use them, reduce the cooking time in step 3 by 1 to 2 minutes. We prefer untreated shrimp, but if your shrimp are treated with sodium or preservatives like sodium tripolyphosphate, skip the brining in step 1 and add 1/8 teaspoon of salt to the sauce in step 4. Serve with crusty bread.\n\n1. Dissolve salt and sugar in 2 cups cold water in container. Submerge shrimp in brine, cover, and refrigerate for 15 minutes. Remove shrimp from brine and pat dry with paper towels.\n\n2. Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons oil in 10-inch skillet over high heat until shimmering. Add shrimp shells and cook, stirring frequently, until they begin to turn spotty brown and skillet starts to brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and carefully add wine and thyme sprigs. When bubbling subsides, return skillet to medium heat and simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for 4 minutes. Strain mixture through colander set over large bowl. Discard shells and reserve liquid (you should have about 1/3 cup). Wipe out skillet with paper towels.\n\n3. Combine lemon juice and cornstarch in small bowl. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil, garlic, pepper flakes, and pepper in now-empty skillet over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is fragrant and just beginning to brown at edges, 3 to 5 minutes. Add reserved wine mixture, increase heat to high, and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to medium, add shrimp, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until shrimp are just opaque, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove skillet from heat, and using slotted spoon, transfer shrimp to bowl.\n\n4. Return skillet to medium heat, add lemon juice–cornstarch mixture and cook until slightly thickened, 1 minute. Remove from heat and whisk in butter and parsley until combined. Return shrimp and any accumulated juices to skillet and toss to combine. Serve, passing lemon wedges separately.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nOur shrimp scampi recipe uses a few test kitchen tricks to ensure flavorful and well-cooked shrimp along with a cohesive, garlicky wine-and-butter sauce. First, we brine the shrimp in salt and sugar to season them throughout and keep them moist and juicy. Then we poach them in wine rather than sauté them, so they cook evenly and gently. To get good seafood flavor into the sauce, we make a stock from the shrimp shells. And for potent garlic flavor, we use a generous amount of sliced garlic—too much minced garlic made the sauce grainy. Finally, to keep the sauce silky and emulsified, we added a teaspoon of cornstarch. Emulsifying with cornstarch means that we can use a little less butter, so the sauce isn’t overly rich.",

Heat 1 teaspoon oil in skillet and repeat with remaining beef. Rinse skillet and dry with paper towels.\n\nAdd remaining tablespoon oil to now-empty skillet and heat until just smoking. Add mushrooms and cook until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Add green beans and cook, stirring frequently, until spotty brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Add water and cover pan; continue to cook until green beans are crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Uncover skillet and push vegetables to sides to clear center; add garlic-ginger mixture to clearing and cook, mashing with spatula, until fragrant, 15 to 20 seconds. Combine garlic-ginger mixture with vegetables. Return beef and any juices to skillet, add scallions, and stir to combine. Whisk sauce to recombine, then add to skillet; cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 30 seconds. Serve.",

    "name": "Pasta Alla Zozzona (Rigatoni with Sausage, Guanciale, and Egg Yolks)",
    "ingredients": "3 large egg yolks (45g)\n2 ounces (60g) finely grated Pecorino Romano cheese, plus more for serving\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n4 ounces (115g) guanciale (cured pork jowl) or pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch-thick batons (see note)\n6 ounces (170g) sweet or hot Italian sausage (2 links), removed from casing\n1 small onion (about 4 ounces; 115g), finely chopped\nPinch red pepper flakes (optional)\n2 cups (500g) tomato passata (see note)\n12 ounces (340g) rigatoni",
    "directions": "1. In a small bowl, beat egg yolks and Pecorino Romano together with a fork until they form a homogeneous thick paste, about 1 minute. Season with a few grindings of black pepper. Set aside. \n[photo:1]\n\n2. In a large skillet, cook guanciale over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and guanciale is golden brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat. Using slotted spoon, transfer guanciale to a plate. Set aside.\n[photo:2]\n\n3. Using clean hands, add sausage to skillet by pinching off 3/4- to 1-inch pieces and arranging in a single layer in the pan. Alternatively, add sausage to skillet all at once, then break up into pieces with a wooden spoon, spreading them out evenly in the pan. Cook over medium heat, undisturbed, until bottom side is light golden brown, about 1 minute. Add onion, season lightly with salt, and, using a thin metal spatula, turn sausage pieces onto uncooked side. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until sausage is cooked through, onion is softened, and fat in the pan is clear and no longer cloudy, 5 to 7 minutes; lower heat at any point if sausage or onion threaten to scorch.\n[photo:3]\n\n4. Add pepper flakes (if using) and bloom in rendered fat until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add tomato passata, season lightly with salt, and bring to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce has thickened slightly and fat has emulsified into sauce, about 10 minutes.\n[photo:4]\n\n5. Meanwhile, in a pot of lightly salted boiling water, cook pasta until softened on the exterior, but well shy of al dente, and still uncooked in the center (about 3 minutes less than the package directs). Using a spider skimmer, transfer pasta to sauce, along with 1/2 cup (120ml) pasta cooking water. Transfer an additional 1/4 cup (60ml) pasta cooking water to bowl with reserved egg yolk-Pecorino Romano paste, and stir with a rubber spatula until smooth and well-combined; set aside. Alternatively, if you don't have a spider skimmer, drain pasta using a colander or fine-mesh strainer, making sure to reserve at least 1 1/2 cups (355ml) pasta cooking water, before proceeding with above instructions.\n[photo:5]\n\n6. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring and tossing rapidly, until pasta is al dente and sauce is thickened and coats noodles, about 2 minutes, adding more pasta cooking water in 1/4 cup (60ml) increments as needed.\n[photo:6]\n\nRemove skillet from heat, add cooked guanciale and egg yolk mixture, and stir and toss rapidly until fully incorporated and pasta is glossy, 15 to 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately, passing more grated cheese at the table.",
    "description": "WHY IT WORKS\n- Slowly cooking guanciale and sausage in stages yields crisp morsels of pork and plenty of flavorful fat to build an emulsified sauce.\n- Finishing cooking the pasta in the sauce ensures that the noodles are well-coated and al dente.\n- Stirring starchy pasta water into a mixture of egg yolks and Pecorino Romano tempers the eggs, keeping them creamy and smooth when they are folded into the pasta off-heat.\n",

    "directions": "Bring 2 cups Marsala, gelatin, and porcini mushrooms to boil in medium saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-high and vigorously simmer until reduced by half, 6 to 8 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, cut each chicken breast in half crosswise, then cut thick half in half again horizontally, creating 3 cutlets of about same thickness. Place cutlets between sheets of plastic wrap and pound gently to even 1/2-inch thickness. Place cutlets in bowl and toss with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Set aside for 15 minutes.\n\nStrain Marsala reduction through fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard solids.

    "directions": "1 .Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F.\n \n2. Remove and discard the chicken giblets. Pat the outside dry. Liberally salt and pepper the inside of the chicken. Cut the lemons in quarters, place 2 quarters in the chicken along with the garlic and reserve the rest of the lemons. Brush the outside of the chicken with olive oil and sprinkle the chicken liberally with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together with kitchen string and tuck the wing tips under the body of the chicken. Place the chicken in a small (11 by 14-inch) roasting pan. (If the pan is too large, the onions will burn.) Place the reserved lemons and the sliced onions in a large bowl and toss with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon of salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of pepper. Pour the mixture around the chicken in the pan.\n \n3. Roast the chicken for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the juices run clear when you cut between a leg and a thigh. Remove the chicken to a platter, cover with aluminum foil, and allow to rest for 10 minutes while you prepare the sauce, leaving the lemons and onions in the pan.\n \n4. Place the pan on top of the stove and turn the heat to medium-high. Add the wine and stir with a wooden spoon to scrape up the brown bits. Add the stock and sprinkle on the flour, stirring constantly for a minute, until the sauce thickens. Add any juices that collect under the chicken. Carve the chicken onto a platter and serve with the lemons, onions, and warm sauce.\n\n",

Transfer olive mixture to bowl with onion mixture. Add ¼ cup oil, mustard, and pepper and toss to combine.\n\nBrush inside of each baguette half with 1 tablespoon oil. Place two-thirds of olive mixture in hollow of baguette bottom and spread evenly. Distribute tuna evenly over olive mixture and drizzle with remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Shingle tomato slices over tuna. Shingle egg slices over tomato. Top eggs with remaining olive mixture and cap with baguette top (sandwich will be very full).\n\nPress gently on sandwich and slice in half crosswise on bias. Wrap each half tightly in plastic wrap. Place rimmed baking sheet on top of sandwiches and weight with heavy Dutch oven or two 5-pound bags of flour or sugar for 1 hour, flipping sandwiches halfway through weighting. (Wrapped sandwiches can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours. Let come to room temperature before serving.)\n\nUnwrap sandwiches, slice each sandwich in half (or in thirds to serve 6) on bias, and serve.",

    "directions": "Heat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. In a large (at least 7-quart) Dutch oven, stir together the pork, onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, oregano, thyme, pepper flakes and 2 teaspoons salt. Stir in the oil and 1 cup water. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook for 3 hours.\n\nRemove the pot from the oven. Stir the pork and return the pot, uncovered, to the oven. Cook until a skewer inserted into the meat meets no resistance, another 30 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a rimmed baking sheet in an even layer to cool. Tilt the pot to pool the cooking liquid to one side, then use a wide spoon to skim off as much fat as possible; reserve the fat. Bring the defatted cooking liquid to a simmer over medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about ⅓ cup, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\n\nWhen the meat is cool enough to handle, break the chunks into ¾- to 1-inch pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat. Add the pork back to the pot and stir until evenly moistened with the reduced cooking liquid.\n\nIn a nonstick 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 teaspoon of the reserved fat until barely smoking. Add the pork in an even layer and cook without stirring, pressing the meat against the skillet with a spatula, until the bottom begins to brown and the pork is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Tip: Don't trim the fat from the pork shoulder. The pork should render its fat in the oven and so the meat cooks slowly in it and the juices. And after cooking, don't discard the fat you skim off the cooking liquid—you'll need some of it to crisp the shredded pork in a hot skillet.",

    "ingredients": "1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n1-1/2 tsp. coarse salt\n1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper\n1 lb. ground beef, medium lean (80 or 85%)\n2 Tbs. vegetable oil; more if necessary\n4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped\n1 Tbs. red curry paste (I like Krung Gaeng Ped brand); more to taste\n1 cup canned coconut milk (refrigerate the can, don’t shake it, and use the thick cream at the top)\n2 Tbs. chunky peanut butter\n2 tsp. fish sauce (nam pla) or to taste\n1-1/2 Tbs. sugar or to taste\n1 tsp. chopped fresh mint or basil leaves for garnish",
    "directions": "Put the flour on a plate. Put the beef in a bowl, sprinkle with the salt and pepper, and mix well. Shape the beef into small, firm balls about 1 inch in diameter; you’ll get 32 to 40. Roll the meatballs in the flour, dusting off the excess.\n\nLine a plate with paper towels. In a wok or frying pan, heat the oil on high until it’s hot. Fry the garlic until browned, about 1 minute; remove and set aside. Add the meatballs and sear them on high heat, stirring and tilting the pan, until they’re browned evenly and cooked through, about 5 minutes; do this in batches, if necessary. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meatballs to the paper towel-lined plate to drain.\n\nIf no oil remains in the pan, add 2 tsp. and fry the red curry paste so it releases its aromas, about 2 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking. Add the reserved garlic and the solidified coconut milk and then stir in the peanut butter. Cook and stir to get a smooth, uniform consistency, about 1 minute. Taste and add fish sauce, sugar, or more curry paste to taste; the sauce shouldn’t be too sweet.\n\nReturn the meatballs to the pan with the sauce and simmer over low heat until they’re hot, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a serving dish and garnish with the mint or basil sprinkled on top.",

    "directions": "1. Heat the oven to 425°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. Place a V-rack inside a large roasting pan. In a small bowl, stir together 2 tablespoons of coriander, 1 tablespoon of cumin, the paprika, garam masala, cayenne and 2 teaspoons salt. Working over a large plate, rub all of the spice mixture evenly over the chicken, using all of the rub and any that has fallen onto the plate, then tie the legs together with kitchen twine. Transfer the chicken breast side up to the rack in the roasting pan. Roast until well browned, the thickest part of the breast reaches 160°F and the thickest part of the thigh reaches 175°F, 70 to 80 minutes.\n\n3. While the chicken cooks, in a food processor, combine the arugula, cilantro, garlic, serranos, the remaining 1 tablespoon coriander, the remaining 1 tablespoon cumin and 1 teaspoon salt. Process until coarsely chopped, about 30 seconds. With the machine running, pour the oil through the feed tube, then process until finely chopped, another 30 seconds. Transfer to a small bowl, then stir in the lime juice. Cover and refrigerate.\n\n3. When the chicken is done, transfer it to a cutting board and let rest for 30 minutes. Remove the rack from the roasting pan. While the chicken rests, add ½ cup water to the roasting pan and stir, scraping up any browned bits. Pour the liquid into a medium bowl, then let settle for 5 minutes. Skim off and discard any fat from the surface. Stir 3 tablespoons of the defatted liquid into the arugula-cilantro mixture, then taste and season with salt and pepper; discard the remaining liquid.\n\n4. Carve the chicken and arrange on a platter. Drizzle with about 3 tablespoons of the chutney, then serve with lime wedges and the remaining chutney on the side.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Don't tent the chicken with foil as it rests or the trapped steam will cause the skin to turn soggy. Also, make sure to allow the chicken to rest for about 30 minutes before carving. If cut too soon, the juices will flow out rather than remain in the meat and keep it moist.",

    "name": "Stuffed Chicken Breasts",
    "ingredients": "4 chicken breasts large, boneless, skinless \n3 tablespoons vegetable oil \n10 ounces white button mushrooms trimmed, wiped clean, and sliced thin \n1 small leeks white part halved lengthwise, washed, and chopped (about 1 cup) \n2 medium garlic cloves minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons) \n1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme chopped \n1 tablespoons fresh lemon juice about 1 lemon \n1/2 cups dry white wine \n1 tablespoons fresh parsley chopped \n1 cups chicken broth * Swanson Organic low-sodium \n1 teaspoons Dijon mustard \n2 tablespoons unsalted butter \n",
    "directions": "FOR THE CHICKEN: Use tip of sharp chefs knife to cut each breast horizontally, starting at thinnest end and stopping knife tip 1/2 inch away from edge so that halves remain attached. Open up breasts to create 4 cutlets. Place 1 cutlet at a time in heavy-duty zipper-lock bag and pound to 1/4-inch thickness (cutlet should measure about 8 inches by 6 inches). Trim about 1/2 inch from long sides of cutlets (about 1 1/2 to 2 ounces of meat per cutlet, or a total of 1/2 cup from all 4 cutlets) to form rectangles that measure about 8 by 5 inches. Process all trimmings in food processor until smooth, about 20 seconds. Transfer puree to medium bowl and set aside. (Do not wash out food processor bowl.)\n\nFOR THE STUFFING: Heat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until all moisture has evaporated and mushrooms are golden brown, 8 to 11 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil and leek; continue to cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 2 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and thyme, and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice and cook until all moisture has evaporated, about 30 seconds. Transfer mixture to bowl of food processor. Return pan to heat; add wine and scrape pan bottom to loosen browned bits. Transfer wine to small bowl and set aside. Rinse and dry skillet.\n\nPulse mushroom mixture in food processor until roughly chopped, about five 1-second pulses. Transfer mushroom mixture to bowl with pureed chicken. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons parsley, 3/4 teaspoon table salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Using rubber spatula, fold together stuffing ingredients until well combined (you should have about 1 1/2 cups stuffing).\n\nTO ASSEMBLE AND COOK: With thinnest ends of cutlets pointing away from you, spread one-quarter of stuffing evenly over each cutlet with rubber spatula, leaving 3/4-inch border along short sides of cutlet and 1/4-inch border along long sides. Roll each breast up as tightly as possible without squeezing out filling and place seam-side down. Evenly space 3 pieces twine (each about 12 inches long) beneath each breast and tie, trimming any excess.\n\nSeason chicken with salt and pepper. Heat remaining tablespoon oil in skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken bundles and brown on 4 sides, about 2 minutes per side. Add broth and reserved wine to pan and bring to boil. Reduce heat to low, cover pan, and cook until instant-read thermometer registers 160 degrees when inserted into thickest part of chicken, 12 to 18 minutes. Transfer chicken to cutting board and tent loosely with foil.\n\nTO MAKE SAUCE AND SERVE: While chicken rests, whisk mustard into cooking liquid. Increase heat to high and simmer, scraping pan bottom to loosen browned bits, until dark brown and reduced to 1/2 cup, 7 to 10 minutes. Off heat, whisk in butter and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons parsley and 1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice; season with salt and pepper. Remove twine and cut each chicken bundle on bias into 6 medallions. Spoon sauce over chicken and serve.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "If your chicken breasts come with the tenderloin attached, pull them off (see Removing Chicken Tenderloins below) \r\nand reserve them to make the puree in step 1. If necessary, trim these breasts to make uniform rectangles and to yield \r\n1 1/2 to 2 ounces total trimmings per breast. Because the stuffing contains raw chicken, it is important to check its \r\ntemperature in step 5.",

Whisk flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda together in medium bowl. In second medium bowl, whisk together buttermilk, sour cream, eggs, and melted butter. Make well in center of dry ingredients and pour in wet ingredients; gently stir until just combined (batter should remain lumpy with few streaks of flour). Do not overmix. Allow batter to sit 10 minutes before cooking.\n\nHeat 1 teaspoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Using paper towels, carefully wipe out oil, leaving thin film of oil on bottom and sides of pan. Using ¼ cup measure, portion batter into pan in 4 places. Cook until edges are set, first side is golden brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes. Using thin, wide spatula, flip pancakes and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Serve pancakes immediately, or transfer to wire rack in preheated oven. Repeat with remaining batter, using remaining oil as necessary.\n\nThe pancakes can be cooked on an electric griddle. Set the griddle temperature to 350 degrees and cook as directed. The test kitchen prefers a lower-protein all-purpose flour like Gold Medal or Pillsbury. If you use an all-purpose flour with a higher protein content, like King Arthur, you will need to add an extra tablespoon or two of buttermilk.\n\n",

Sprinkle barbecue rub all over armadillo eggs, then place eggs on cool side grill and cover, with top air vent positioned over cool side of grill.

    "directions": "Marinating the onion and cucumber in the vinaigrette tones down the onion's harshness and flavors the cucumber. For efficiency, prepare the other salad ingredients while the onion and cucumber marinate. Use a salad spinner to dry the lettuce thoroughly after washing; any water left clinging to the leaves will dilute the dressing.\n\n1. Whisk vinaigrette ingredients in large bowl until combined. Add onion and cucumber and toss; let stand to blend flavors, about 20 minutes.\n\n2. Add romaine, tomatoes, parsley, mint, and peppers to bowl with onions and cucumbers; toss to coat with dressing.\n\n3. Transfer salad to wide, shallow serving bowl or platter; sprinkle olives and feta over salad. Serve immediately.",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nMost versions of Greek salad consist of iceberg lettuce, chunks of green pepper, and a few pale wedges of tomato, sparsely dotted with cubes of feta and garnished with one forlorn olive of questionable heritage. For our Greek salad, we aimed a little higher: We wanted a salad with crisp ingredients and bold flavors, highlighted by briny olives and tangy feta, all blended together with a bright-tasting dressing infused with fresh herbs. For a dressing with balanced flavor, we used a combination of lemon juice and red wine vinegar and added fresh oregano, olive oil, and a small amount of garlic. We poured the dressing over fresh vegetables, including Romaine lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cucumbers, as well as other ingredients, including fresh mint and parsley, roasted peppers, and a generous sprinkling of feta cheese and olives.",

    "ingredients": "206 grams (1½ cups) bread flour, plus more for dusting\n35 grams (¼ cup) whole-wheat flour\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n3/4 cup plain whole-milk yogurt\n2 teaspoons honey\n3 tablespoons salted butter, melted, or flavored butter",
    "directions": "01 In a large bowl, stir together both flours, the salt and baking powder. Add the yogurt and honey and stir until a shaggy dough forms. Using your hands, knead in the bowl until the dough forms a cohesive ball, incorporating any dry bits; the dough will be slightly sticky.\n\n02 Turn the dough out onto a counter dusted with bread flour and continue kneading until the dough is tacky instead of sticky, about 1 minute. The finished dough may appear slightly lumpy; this is fine. Divide into 6 pieces and shape each into a ball. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high.\n\n03 On a lightly floured counter, roll each ball to an 8-inch circle. Place one dough round in the heated skillet and cook until the bottom is dark spotty brown, 1 to 1½ minutes. Using tongs, flip the round and cook the second side until dark spotty brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a wire rack, flipping so the first side to cook faces down, then brush with butter. Repeat with the remaining dough rounds. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "Made throughout the Middle East, non-yeasted flatbreads are the definition of quick bread, taking relatively little time to prepare. We added yogurt to a whole wheat- and honey-flavored dough for both its tangy bite and tenderizing qualities. Bread flour gives these flatbreads pleasant chew, but you can substitute an equal amount of all-purpose flour. If you do use all-purpose, you will likely have to add a couple extra tablespoons of flour during kneading because the dough will be slightly wetter. You'll need a 12-inch cast-iron skillet; a 10-inch cast-iron skillet will work, too, but there will be a little less room for maneuvering the rounds when flipping. We liked serving these with flavored butters—including garlic-herb, za'atar and harissa.\n\nDon't leave any floury bits in the bowl during mixing. All the flour must be incorporated so that the dough isn't too sticky to work with. Don't overflour the counter when rolling out the rounds; excess flour will scorch in the skillet.",

    "ingredients": "2 cups (500ml) homemade chicken stock or store-bought low-sodium broth\n4 packets unflavored powdered gelatin (3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon; 30g)\n2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil, plus more as needed\n3 pounds (1.25kg) whole boneless beef chuck roast, cut crosswise into 3 steaks\n4 teaspoons (12g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, divided; for table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight\n1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 1/4 pounds carrots (600g; about 3 large), 1/2 pound (250g) peeled and split lengthwise, 3/4 pound (350g) cut into large dice (about 1 1/2 cups)\n1 medium yellow onion (8 ounces; ; 227g), peeled and split in half through the root\n4 medium cloves garlic, lightly crushed\n1/4 cup (60ml) cognac or brandy (optional)\n3 cups (750ml) dry red wine\n1 tablespoon (15ml) fish sauce\n1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce\n1 bouquet garni (about 4 sprigs thyme, 3 sprigs parsley, and 1 bay leaf, tied together with kitchen twine)\n5 tablespoons all-purpose flour (1.4 ounces; 40g)\n1/4 pound (110g) slab bacon or salt pork, cut into 1-inch-long by 1/4-inch-thick sticks (about 1 cup)\n1 pound cremini mushrooms (450g), woody stems trimmed if necessary and caps quartered\n8 ounces white and/or red pearl onions (225g), peeled\nMinced flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems, for garnish",
    "directions": "Preheat oven to 325°F (160°C). Pour chicken stock into a medium bowl and sprinkle gelatin evenly all over surface, allowing each packet's worth of gelatin to soak up stock before sprinkling next one on. Set aside.\n\nIn a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Season beef all over with 3 teaspoons of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook, turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10 minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet.\n\nLower heat to medium; add split carrots, halved onion, and garlic to Dutch oven and cook, turning occasionally, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes.\n\nAdd brandy, if using, and boil until alcohol has nearly cooked off, about 2 minutes. (If not using brandy, proceed with next step.)\n\nScrape chicken stock and gelatin mixture into Dutch oven. Add red wine, fish sauce, soy sauce, and bouquet garni and bring to a simmer over medium high, then lower heat to medium to maintain simmer. Meanwhile, cut beef into 2-inch chunks and transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add flour and stir until beef is evenly coated in a floury paste. Add beef and any accumulated juices to Dutch oven. Bring back to a simmer then transfer to oven, partially cover with a lid, and cook until beef starts to become tender, about 2 hours.\n\nMeanwhile, in a large nonstick skillet, cook bacon lardons over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and lardons are lightly browned and crisp, 4 to 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer lardons to a plate.\n\nAdd mushrooms to skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have released their liquid and browned, about 10 minutes; add oil as needed if pan becomes too dry. Add diced carrots and pearl onions and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes.\n\nRemove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard large pieces of carrot and onion. Discard bouquet garni. Using a ladle, skim off and discard accumulated fat on surface. Add reserved lardons and sautéed carrots, onions, and mushrooms to stew, return to oven, and continue to cook, uncovered, until beef is fork tender, pearl onions are soft but still hold their shape, and sauce is nappe, about 1 hour.\n\nRemove stew from oven. If serving right away, skim off any additional fat from surface. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Allow to cool slightly before serving, then serve topped with parsley. If making ahead, cool down stew, then chill in refrigerator; remove solid fat cap from surface once fully chilled. Reheat stew on the stovetop or in a low oven.\n\nThe stew can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days.",

    "directions": "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Using a sharp knife, cut all around the top of the bread loaf, and remove the top or \"lid\" of the bread. Set this \"lid\" aside, to eat or use in another recipe. Then, measuring in about 3/4 inch from the edge of the loaf, cut down into and all around the loaf, taking care not to penetrate the bottom, to create a neat edge from which to remove the interior crumb. Twist the soft insides to loosen them, then pull them out, so you have a large receptacle or shell. If the insides of the bread are very soft, cut them into pieces and dry them briefly in the hot oven. Then place about half of the insides into the bowl of a food processor, and process to make 2½ to 3 cups of crumbs. Set these aside, and keep the remainder of the bread insides for another use. \n\nFor the garlic-herb butter: Put the parsley, other herbs, and garlic in the food-processor bowl, and process until the mixture is chopped fine. Add the pecans, softened butter, salt, pepper, and white wine, and process until blended. Stir in the shallots. Using a large spatula, coat the inside of the hollow loaf with about a third of the garlic-herb butter. \n\nCut the shrimp, scallops, and salmon into 1-inch pieces, and slice the mushrooms. Sprinkle half the mushrooms and half the seafood into the bread receptacle, and sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Add a layer of the garlic-herb butter, then about half of the breadcrumbs, and the remainder of the seafood and mushrooms. Season lightly with salt and pepper. \n\nFinally, spread the remaining butter on top, cover with the remaining breadcrumbs, and moisten the breadcrumbs with the vermouth. Place the filled bread loaf on a cookie sheet, and bake for about 1 hour. Let the bread rest for 10 minutes after it comes out of the oven, then cut it into large chunks, and serve immediately.",

In large bowl, whisk together yogurt, oil, garlic, and ginger; set aside.\n\nFOR THE SAUCE: Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently, until light golden, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, chile, tomato paste, and garam masala; cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes, sugar, and salt; bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in cream and return to simmer. Remove pan from heat and cover to keep warm.\n\nWhile sauce simmers, adjust oven rack to upper-middle position (about 6 inches from heating element) and heat broiler. Using tongs, dip chicken into yogurt mixture (chicken should be coated with thick layer of yogurt) and arrange on wire rack set in foil-lined rimmed baking sheet or broiler pan. Discard excess yogurt mixture. Broil chicken until thickest parts register 160 degrees on instant-read thermometer and exterior is lightly charred in spots, 10 to 18 minutes, flipping chicken halfway through cooking.\n\nLet chicken rest 5 minutes, then cut into 1-inch chunks and stir into warm sauce (do not simmer chicken in sauce). Stir in cilantro, adjust seasoning with salt, and serve.\n\n",

    "notes": "This dish is best when prepared with whole-milk yogurt, but low-fat yogurt can be substituted. For a spicier dish, do not remove the ribs and seeds from the chile. If you prefer, substitute 2 teaspoons ground coriander, 1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper for the garam masala. The sauce can be made ahead, refrigerated for up to 4 days in an airtight container, and gently reheated before adding the hot chicken. Serve with basmati rice.",

    "directions": "FOR THE SAUCE: Whisk all ingredients together in bowl and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow flavors to meld. (Sauce can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.)\n\nFOR THE BEEF: Sprinkle beef with 4 teaspoons (16 grams) kosher salt. Arrange pieces side by side along natural seam, and then tie together at 1 inch intervals to create 1 evenly shaped roast. Wrap roast in plastic, transfer to large plate, and refrigerate at least 24 hours or up to 96 hours.\n\nUsing sous vide circulator, heat water to 133°F/56°C in 12-quart container.\n\nHeat oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown roast on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes. Season roast with pepper and place into 2-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Gently lower bag into prepared water bath until roast is fully submerged, and then clip top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook for at least 18 hours or up to 24 hours.\n\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 475°F/246°C. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and spray with vegetable spray. Transfer roast to prepared rack and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Pat roast dry with paper towels.\n\nWhisk egg white in bowl until frothy, about 30 seconds. Combine peppercorns and flake sea salt in shallow dish. Brush roast on all sides with egg white, then coat with peppercorn mixture, pressing to adhere. Return roast to prepared rack and roast until surface is evenly browned and fragrant, 15 to 20 minutes, rotating sheet halfway through roasting.\n\nTransfer roast to carving board and slice into ½-inch-thick slices, removing pieces of twine as you slice, and serve.\n\nLike this recipe?

    "description": "True one-pan meals are hard to come by, but one that also cooks all the components at once—without adding ingredients in stages—is a unicorn. For a totally hands-off one-pan meal of meatloaf, roasted potatoes, and Brussels sprouts, we started by choosing straightforward meatloaf ingredients that didn’t require precooking (such as mushrooms or onions). A panade of crushed saltines and milk kept the ground beef moist in the oven. Soy sauce and grated Parmesan cheese added savory depth to the meatloaf while fresh thyme, granulated garlic, and red pepper flakes added pep. Two eggs held the meatloaf together, and a coating of ketchup turned into an intensely sweet and tangy glaze that nicely complemented the meat. Hearty small red potatoes and Brussels sprouts were the perfect vegetables to roast alongside the meatloaf; they only got better the longer they cooked in the 400-degree oven, turning creamy inside and deeply browned and crisp on the bottom. To brighten up the vegetables’ deep roasted flavor, we gave them a quick toss in a lemon-parsley oil just before serving",

    "directions": "FOR THE SAUCE: Heat oil, chili powder, peppercorns, and cinnamon in 14-inch wok or 12-inch nonstick skillet over low heat for 10 minutes. Using rubber spatula, transfer oil mixture to bowl (do not wash wok). Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, wheat paste, and sesame paste into oil mixture. Divide evenly among 4 shallow bowls.\n\nFOR THE NOODLES: Bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. While water comes to boil, combine pork, Shaoxing wine, and soy sauce in medium bowl and toss with your hands until well combined. Set aside. Working with 1 head bok choy at a time, trim base (larger leaves will fall off) and halve lengthwise through core. Rinse well.\n\nHeat 2 teaspoons oil in now-empty wok over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add reserved pork mixture and use rubber spatula to smear into thin layer across surface of wok. Break up meat into ¼-inch chunks with edge of spatula and cook, stirring frequently, until pork is firm and well browned, about 5 minutes. Push pork mixture to far side of wok and add garlic, ginger, and remaining 1 teaspoon oil to cleared space. Cook, stirring constantly, until garlic mixture begins to brown, about 1 minute. Stir to combine pork mixture with garlic mixture. Remove wok from heat.\n\nAdd bok choy to boiling water and cook until leaves are vibrant green and stems are crisp-tender, about 1 minute. Using slotted spoon or spider skimmer, transfer boy choy to plate; set aside. Add noodles to boiling water and cook, stirring often, until almost tender (center should still be firm with slightly opaque dot). Drain noodles. Rinse under hot running water, tossing with tongs, for 1 minute. Drain well.\n\nDivide noodles evenly among prepared bowls. Return wok with pork to medium heat. Add ya cai and cook, stirring frequently, until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Spoon equal amounts of pork topping over noodles. Divide bok choy evenly among bowls, shaking to remove excess moisture as you portion. Top with scallions and serve, leaving each diner to stir components together before eating.",

    "notes": "\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nSichuan's most popular street food consists of chewy noodles bathed in a spicy, fragrant chili sauce and topped with crispy, deeply savory bits of pork and plump, juicy lengths of baby bok choy. Gently heating Sichuan chili powder, ground Sichuan peppercorns, and cinnamon in vegetable oil for just 10 minutes yielded a flavorful chili oil base for the sauce. Whisking in soy sauce, Chinese black vinegar, sweet wheat paste, and Chinese sesame paste added earthy, faintly sweet depth and appropriately thickened the mixture. We smeared the ground pork into a thin layer across the wok with a rubber spatula, jabbing at it with the tool's edge to break it up into bits, and seared it hard to produce crispy bits that clung to the noodles. Stirring in minced garlic and grated ginger, plus a big scoop of the Sichuan pickle called ya cai, added unique tang and complexity. Blanching baby bok choy brightened its color and freed water from its cell walls, giving the vegetable its juicy, palate-cleansing effect. We trimmed the base of each bulb and halved the bulbs lengthwise to create bite-size pieces that softened at the same rate. Saving the blanching water to boil the noodles was efficient, and thoroughly rinsing them after they were cooked washed away surface starch that would have caused them to stick together. ",

    "directions": "\t1. FOR THE PASTE: Mince garlic clove with salt to form smooth paste. Combine garlic paste with olive oil, lemon juice, and chopped fresh oregano leaves in a medium bowl. Set aside.\n\t2. FOR THE SHRIMP: Pour 2 quarts very cold water into large bowl. Add salt and sugar and stir until dissolved. Add shrimp and let stand in refrigerator for 30 minutes. Drain shrimp. Open shells with manicure scissors and devein if desired (see illustrations below). Toss shrimp and paste in medium bowl to coat.\n\t3. Meanwhile, light large chimney starter filled with hardwood charcoal (about 2 1/2 pounds) and allow to burn until charcoal is covered with layer of fine gray ash. Spread coals evenly over grill bottom for medium-hot fire. Set cooking rack in place, cover grill with lid, and let rack heat up, about 5 minutes. Alternatively, preheat gas grill with all burners set to high and lid down until grill is very hot, about 15 minutes. Scrape rack clean with wire brush.\n\t4. Thread shrimp on skewers as illustrated below. Grill shrimp, uncovered for charcoal or covered for gas, turning skewers once, until shells are barely charred and bright pink, 4 to 6 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature with lemon wedges.\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "We recommend that you brine the shrimp before grilling. This makes them especially plump and juicy. To keep the shrimp from dropping through the grill rack onto the hot coals, thread them onto skewers. The fresh oregano in this recipe can be replaced with other fresh herbs, including chives, tarragon, parsley, or basil.",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "**Prepare ahead**\n\nFor best results, prepare each piece individually. If you don't want to measure the dry ingredients every time you bake, feel free to prepare your own baking mix ahead. Take 10 tablespoons (150 ml) almond flour, 10 tablespoons (150 ml) coconut flour, 1 teaspoon salt and 2 1/2 tablespoons baking powder. Then you have the dry mix ready for 10 pieces. Use 2 generous tablespoons for each piece of bread.\n\n**Storing the bread**\n\nFeel free to make several pieces once you get cooking. You can keep the unbaked dough in the refrigerator for 2-3 days or you can even freeze the mixture. It will thaw in a few minutes at room temperature.\n\nFlavoring\n\nFor additional flavor, season the bread with onion or garlic powder, plus herbs or spices like ground fennel and cumin. It's also lovely with poppy, chia, hemp, or sesame seeds. Use about 1/2 teaspoon of seasoning for each piece.",

Cover bowl and refrigerate chicken for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours.\n\nTightly thread chicken strips lengthwise onto skewers in S shape until no more than 1 inch of skewer is exposed on either end, 4 or 5 strips per skewer.\n\nFOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\nFOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high; cover; and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.\n\nClean and oil cooking grate. Place kebabs on grill (over coals, if using charcoal) and cook (covered, if using gas) until chicken is lightly charred and registers 160 degrees, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to serving platter and let rest while preparing tahini-butter sauce.\n\nFOR THE TAHINI-BUTTER SAUCE: Whisk tahini, lemon juice, salt, pepper, and oregano in bowl until combined. Slowly whisk in melted butter until emulsified.\n\nDrizzle tahini-butter sauce over chicken and serve.",
    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\n\nSouvlaki is a dish of marinated meat (or occasionally vegetables) threaded onto skewers or a spit (“souvla” means “spit” in Greek) and cooked over a fire. We had a version at Johnny's Restaurant in Homewood, Alabama, that we couldn't forget. Inspired by chef Timothy Hontzas's technique, we first marinated strips of boneless, skinless chicken breasts in a bold mixture of lemon zest, olive oil, oregano, thyme, and other seasonings. We then threaded the strips onto skewers in an S shape, which allowed the potent marinade to get stuck in the crannies of the folded chicken, providing concentrated pops of flavor. After getting some good char on the meat by grilling it over high heat, we drizzled it with a tahini-butter sauce (also inspired by the version at Johnny's Restaurant) to cloak the chicken with an extra layer of richness and allure.",
    "notes": "2025-04-20 - made with chicken breast. Very good, just use thermometer to not overcook \n2022-05-30 - Made at Dad and Moms using chicken thighs. Crowd pleaser.",

    "notes": "Take care to cut the potatoes into evenly sized wedges so that all of the pieces will cook at about the same rate. Although it isn’t required, a nonstick baking sheet works particularly well for this recipe. It not only keeps the fries from sticking to the pan but, because of its dark color, encourages deep and even browning. Whether you choose a nonstick baking sheet or a regular baking sheet, make sure that it is heavy duty. The intense heat of the oven may cause lighter pans to warp.",

    "name": "Chicken, Salsa Verde and Tortilla Casserole (Pastel Azteca)",
    "ingredients": "1 pound poblano chilies\n1½ pounds tomatillos, husked and halved\n3 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled\n2 tablespoons white vinegar\n1 cup lightly packed fresh cilantro, plus ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro, divided\n3 teaspoons ground cumin, divided\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon grapeseed or other neutral oil\n1 pound boneless, skinless chicken thighs\n1 large white onion, chopped\n1 cup corn kernels, defrosted if frozen\n8 6-inch corn tortillas\n12 ounces pepper Jack cheese, shredded (4 cups)\n1 cup Mexican crema or one 8-ounce container crème fraîche, room temperature\n4 ounces cotija cheese (see headnote), grated (1 cup)\n2 tablespoons pumpkin seeds, finely chopped (optional)\n",
    "directions": "01 Heat the broiler with a rack about 6 inches from the element. Place the poblanos on a rimmed baking sheet and broil until charred, about 10 minutes. Flip the chilies and broil until charred on the second sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl, cover and let steam to loosen the skins while you make the puree and cook the chicken. Turn the oven to 375°F.\n\n02 In a blender, combine the tomatillos, garlic, vinegar, 1 cup of cilantro, 2 teaspoons of cumin and 1 teaspoons salt. Blend until smooth, about 1 minute, scraping the blender jar as needed; set the puree aside.\n\n03 In a large Dutch oven over medium-high, heat the oil until shimmering. Carefully add the puree (it may splatter) and cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly reduced and a spoon drawn through leaves a brief trail, about 6 minutes. Remove ½ cup of the sauce and set aside. To the remaining sauce in the pot, add the chicken, onion, the remaining 1 teaspoon cumin, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper. Bring to a simmer, then cover, reduce to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until a skewer inserted into the chicken meets no resistance, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n04 While the chicken cooks, peel the skins off the chilies and remove and discard the stems and seeds. Chop the chilies and set aside. When the chicken is done, remove the pot from the heat. Using 2 forks, shred the chicken; you should have about 3½ cups chicken in salsa verde. If you have more, return the pot to medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced. Stir in the corn, the ¼ cup of the chopped cilantro and the chopped chilies. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n\n05 Wrap the exterior of a 9-inch springform pan with a sheet of foil and set on a rimmed baking sheet. Add half of the reserved salsa to the pan and spread in an even layer. Line the bottom of the pan with 2⅔ tortillas, tearing them as needed to fit; it’s fine if the tortillas overlap slightly and if a few small spots are uncovered. Spoon in half of the chicken mixture and distribute in an even layer. Dollop with half of the crema, then spread evenly. Sprinkle with a third of the pepper Jack cheese. Repeat the layering using another 2⅔ tortillas, the remaining chicken mixture, the remaining crema and half of the remaining pepper Jack. Layer in the remaining tortillas, then spread evenly with the remaining reserved salsa. Sprinkle on the remaining pepper Jack followed by the cotija. Bake the pastel on the baking sheet until browned on top and bubbling at the edges, about 35 minutes.\n\n06 Set the baking sheet on a wire rack. Sprinkle the pastel with the remaining ¼ cup chopped cilantro and the pumpkin seeds (if using). Let rest for at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour.\n\n07 To serve, run a knife around the inside of the springform pan to loosen. Remove the foil, set the pan on a large, flat platter and remove the sides. Cut into wedges and serve.",
    "description": "Though pastel azteca translates from the Spanish as “Aztec cake,” the dish often is referred to in English as Mexican lasagna, enchilada casserole or tortilla pie—and understandably so. It is comprised of corn tortillas layered with sauce, meat, cheeses, crema (a cultured cream similar to crème fraîche) and vegetables; a stint in the oven brings together all the elements. Our recipe is an adaptation of the pastel azteca taught to us in Mexico City by chef Esmerelda Brinn Bolaños. We swapped chicken thighs for the dark-meat turkey that she used and found readily available substitutes for the locally made Mexican cheeses. We opted for pepper Jack cheese because of its melting qualities and mild spiciness; if you prefer, use regular Jack cheese or even mozzarella. To assemble and bake the casserole, we use a 9-inch springform pan for a presentation that reveals the impressive layers and allows for slicing into wedges for serving. ",
    "notes": "Don’t use sour cream in place of Mexican crema. Sour cream has a lower fat content and will curdle during baking. If crema is not available, crème fraîche is the next best option, but it’s much thicker than crema, so allow it to come to room temperature before use so it’s easier to spread. Don’t slice the pastel until it has rested for at least 30 minutes to allow the layers to set up for easier slicing and serving.",

    "directions": "Arrange oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).\n\nFor the Braciole: In a medium bowl, add breadcrumbs, Parmigiano-Reggiano, parsley, pine nuts, olive oil, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and red pepper flakes and stir until well combined. Set aside.\n\nIf using a top round roast, slice roast into six 1/2 -inch slices. If using pre-sliced beef, skip to Step 5.\n\nLay steak slices 3 inches apart on a cutting board and cover with plastic wrap. Using meat pounder, flatten slices into rough rectangles measuring no more than 1/4 inch thick.\n\nSprinkle both sides of steaks with salt and remaining 1/2 teaspoon black pepper. Spread the reserved breadcrumb mixture evenly over steaks, then place 1 slice of prosciutto over each breadcrumb-topped steak, folding prosciutto to fit and pressing firmly into steak. Being careful to keep filling in place and starting from a short end of each steak, roll each steak to form a small bundle. Tie each bundle with 2 pieces of kitchen twine to secure.\n\nFor the Sauce: In a large sauté pan, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add braciole bundles and brown on all sides, 6 to 8 minutes total. Transfer browned braciole to a clean plate; set aside.\n\nAdd onion and salt to the now-empty pan and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until just fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan, and cook until mixture reduces by half, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and water. Nestle the browned braciole bundles into the sauce and bring the sauce to a simmer.\n\nCover the pan with an oven-safe lid or aluminum foil. Place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet and transfer to the oven. Cook, covered, flipping braciole halfway through, for 90 minutes. Carefully remove the lid, flip the braciole again, and continue to cook until the meat is fully tender and sauce thickened to gravy-like consistency, 15 to 45 minutes longer.\n\nSeason sauce with salt to taste. Use scissors to cut off twine around each bundle. Transfer braciole to a large serving platter or individual plates and spoon sauce overtop. Serve.",

    "notes": "I strongly encourage you ask your butcher to slice the beef for you, or use thin pre-sliced top round steaks, sometimes sold as “braciole steaks,” can be found in some supermarkets, Italian grocers, or butchers. If cutting steaks from a top round roast yourself, look for a longer, oval shaped roast to create longer thin steaks for wrapping.",

    "ingredients": "1 pound fresh skinless snapper, bass, halibut or other ocean fish fillets (the fish I listed I like because they have a large flake or meaty texture), cut into ½-inch cubes or slightly smaller\n1 1/2 cups fresh lime juice\n1 medium white onion, chopped into ¼-inch pieces\n2 medium-large (1 pound total) tomatoes, chopped into ¼ inch pieces\nFresh hot green chile to taste (roughly 2 to 3 serranos or 1 to 2 jalapeños), stemmed, seeded and finely chopped\n1/3 cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus a few leaves for garnish\n1/3 cup chopped pitted green olives (choose manzanillos for a typical Mexican flavor)\n1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil, preferably extra-virgin (optional but recommended to give a glistening appearance)\nSalt\n3 tablespoons fresh orange juice OR 1/2 teaspoon sugar\n1 large or 2 small ripe avocados, peeled, pitted and diced\nTostadas, tortilla chips or saltine crackers for serving",
    "directions": "**Marinating the fish.**\nIn a 1 ½-quart glass or stainless steel bowl, combine the fish, lime juice and onion. You’ll need enough juice to cover the fish and allow it to float somewhat freely; too little juice means unevenly “cooked” fish. Cover and refrigerate for about 20 minutes, until a cube of fish no longer looks raw when broken open. Pour into a colander and drain off the lime juice (reserving it for a Fishy Michelada Cocktail if you're so inclined).\n\n**The flavorings**. \nIn a large bowl, mix together the tomatoes, green chiles, cilantro, olives and optional olive oil. Stir in the fish, then taste and season with salt, usually about ¾ teaspoon, and orange juice or sugar (the sweetness of the orange juice or sugar helps balance some of the typical tanginess of the ceviche). Cover and refrigerate if not serving immediately.\n\n**Serving the ceviche.** \nJust before serving, stir in the diced avocado, being careful not to break up the pieces. For serving, you have several options: set out your ceviche in a large bowl and let people spoon it onto individual plates to eat with chips or saltines; serve small bowls of ceviche (I like to lay a bed of frisée lettuce in each bowl before spooning in the ceviche) and serve tostadas, chips or saltines alongside; or pile the ceviche onto chips or tostadas and pass around for guests to consume on these edible little plates. Whichever direction you choose, garnish the ceviche with leaves of cilantro before setting it center stage.\n\nWorking ahead: The fish may be marinated a day in advance; after about 4 hours, when the fish is “cooked,” drain it so that it won’t become too limey. For the freshest flavor, add the flavorings to the fish no more than a couple of hours before serving.",

    "directions": "Combine garlic, cilantro, sugar, white pepper, coriander, soy sauce, lemongrass, and half of oil in the bowl of a food processor. Process until a paste is formed, about 1 minute, scraping down sides as necessary. Brush or rub half of mixture over tofu slabs, stacking them in a plastic container or on a plate as you go.\n\n**To Cook on the Grill: **Light one chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and arrange the coals on one side of the charcoal grate. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Alternatively, set half the burners on a gas grill to the highest heat setting, cover, and preheat for 10 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Place tofu over cooler side of grill at 45-degree angle to the grill grates. Cover and cook for 5 minutes. Carefully rotate tofu 90 degrees and continue cooking until bottom side is crisp and has distinct hash marks, about 5 minutes longer. Carefully flip tofu and repeat cooking and rotating steps until crisp on both sides. Continue with step 4 and transfer tofu to a large plate to cool.\n\nTo Cook Under the Broiler: Oil a wire cooling rack and set it in a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Arrange tofu slices on top in a single layer. Adjust rack to 6 to 8 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler to low (if your oven has two broiler settings, otherwise just preheat the broiler). Broil tofu, turning and rotating every few minutes until crisp and browned on both sides, about 20 minutes total. Continue with step 4 and transfer tofu to a large plate to cool.\n\nWhile tofu cooks, combine remaining marinade with remaining oil in a small bowl. When tofu is cooked, transfer to a large plate or cutting board and, using a brush or the back of a spoon, coat each piece with the remaining marinade. Cut each piece into slices slightly narrower than the baguettes.\n\nPlace baguettes on the cooler side of the grill (or place in oven and immediately shut off broiler if cooking indoors). Cover and cook until heated through and crisp, about 5 minutes. Split baguettes, leaving them hinged on one side. Spread with mayonnaise. Sprinkle bottoms and tops with liquid aminos, then spoon on a thin layer of the ginger-scallion oil if using. Layer with sliced tofu. Add pickled carrot/daikon mixture, cucumber spears, jalapeño, and cilantro. Season to taste with salt, close sandwiches, split in half crosswise (or if using full-sized standard baguettes, cut each into 3 to 4 serving pieces), and serve immediately.",

    "name": "Quadruple Smoked Potatoes",
    "ingredients": "4 large baking potatoes (12 to 14 ounces)\n4 strips artisanal bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slivers\n1 tablespoon bacon fat (from below), melted butter, or extra-virgin olive oil\nCoarse sea salt and freshly ground black pepper\nFor the stuffing:\n5 tablespoons butter at room temperature\n4 tablespoons finely chopped scallions\n2 cups coarsely grated smoked cheddar cheese (about 8 ounces)\n1/2 cup sour cream\nPimentón (smoked paprika) for sprinkling",
    "directions": "Step 1: Set up your grill for indirect grilling and preheat to medium (350 degrees). Brush and oil the grill grate.\n\nStep 2: Scrub the potatoes on all sides with a vegetable brush. Rinse well and blot dry with paper towels. Prick the potato skin 3 or 4 times with a fork.\n\nStep 3: Cook the bacon: Place it in a cold skillet and fry over medium heat until browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. (You can do this on the grill grate, on a side burner, or on the stovetop.) Transfer the bacon pieces to a large mixing bowl. Leave the bacon fat in the pan.\n\nStep 4: Brush or rub the potato on all sides with the bacon fat and season generously with salt and pepper.\n\nStep 5: Place the potatoes on the grill over the drip pan away from the heat. Toss the wood chips on the coals or place in your gas grill’s smoker box. Smoke-roast the potatoes until tender, 1 to 1-1/2 hours. To test for doneness, pierce a potato through the top with a slender metal or bamboo skewer. It should pierce easily. Transfer the potatoes to a cutting board. Remove from the potato rack, if using.\n\nStep 6: Cut each potato in half lengthwise. Using a spoon, scrape out most of the potato flesh, leaving a 1/4-inch thick layer next to the skin. (Note: It’s easier to scoop the potatoes when they are hot. Insulated food gloves will protect your hands.) Very roughly chop the scooped potato and place in the mixing bowl with the bacon.\n\nStep 7: Add the 4 tablespoons butter, the scallions, and 1-1/2 cups grated cheese and gently stir to mix. Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the sour cream and salt and pepper to taste: The mixture should be highly seasoned. Stir as little as possible so as to leave some texture to the potatoes.\n\nStep 8: Stuff the potato mixture back into the potato skins, mounding it in the center. Sprinkle each potato with the remaining cheese and top with a thin slice of butter (from the remaining 1 tablespoon). Sprinkle each stuffed potato with pimentón. The potatoes can be prepared up to 24 hours ahead to this stage, covered and refrigerated.\n\nStep 9: Just before serving, reheat the potatoes on your grill until browned and bubbling, 15 to 20 minutes, or as needed. (If the potatoes have been refrigerated, allow 25 to 30 minutes for reheating.)",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "If you like smoke, you’re going to love these smoked potatoes. The flavor comes at you from all directions—smoky bacon, smoked cheddar cheese, pimentón (Spanish smoked paprika), and of course, smoke-roasting the whole potatoes on the grill.\n\nNote: You can certainly smoke the potatoes in a smoker. I prefer indirect grilling with wood smoke—the higher temperature gives you crisper skin.",

With a slotted spoon, carefully transfer the cod to a platter, cover it and set it aside to continue cooking in its own residual heat.\n\nAdd the olives, capers, horseradish and sour cream to the pan and bring to a boil.\n\nArrange a cod fillet on each of 4 plates and top with the sauce. Sprinkle the cilantro over. Serve immediately.",

    "name": "Pommes De Terre Fondantes (Fondant Potatoes)",
    "ingredients": "1 1/2 cups homemade chicken or beef stock, or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth, plus extra as needed\n1/4 ounce (2 1/2 teaspoons; 1 packet; 7 g) unflavored gelatin, such as Knox\n2 1/2 pounds (1.1 kg) Yukon Gold potatoes, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long each, peeled\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons (30 ml) vegetable oil, beef fat, schmaltz, or duck fat (see note)\n4 tablespoons (55 g) unsalted butter\n3 medium garlic cloves (15 g), peeled and smashed\n1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped\nFlaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for finishing (optional)",
    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Place stock in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over top. Set aside.\n\nVicky Wasik\n\nUsing a sharp knife, cut off ends of potatoes to give them flat sides, then halve potatoes crosswise. Pat dry with paper towels.\n\nIn a 12-inch stainless steel straight-sided sauté pan or skillet, or cast iron skillet, heat oil or fat over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Season potatoes with salt and pepper and add to skillet, broad side down, in a single layer with space between each piece. Cook, without moving, until potatoes begin to brown around edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, rotating and swirling pan gently to promote even browning and prevent sticking, until potatoes are deeply browned on bottom side, 3 to 4 minutes longer, adjusting heat as needed if some of the pieces brown too quickly.\n\nUsing a thin metal spatula, flip potatoes onto second flat side. Add butter and cook, swirling constantly, until butter is melted and begins to foam, about 1 minute. Add garlic and thyme, and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add stock and bring to a boil.\n\nTransfer skillet to oven and roast until potatoes are completely tender, offering little to no resistance when poked with a paring knife, and liquid is reduced to a saucy consistency, 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nReturn skillet to stovetop. Using a thin metal spatula or tongs, transfer potatoes to a serving platter, broad side up, leaving sauce in the skillet; discard garlic. Bring sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook, swirling and stirring constantly, until sauce is emulsified, 30 seconds to 1 minute. If emulsion appears broken or sauce is too thick, add more stock or water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper and pour sauce over and around potatoes. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt (if using, otherwise season with a little more kosher salt), and serve.\n\nVicky Wasik\n\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately, but leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat with additional stock, up to 1/4 cup (60ml), to loosen and then re-emulsify the sauce.",

    "directions": "First, prep the vegetables, mixing them together in a bowl. \n\nStem and finely chop 1 large fresh serrano or 1 small fresh jalapeño chile.\n\nTwist off a small handful of cilantro (where the leaves begin) and, holding it tightly bunched, thinly slice across the leaves and tender upper stems. \n\nFinely dice 1/2 of a small white onion, scoop into a strainer and run under cold water for 30 seconds or so to “deflame” it; shake off the excess water and measure 1/3 cup.\n\nChop 1 small ripe tomato into ¼-inch bits (to ensure they won’t soften the avocado with too much moisture, we let the tomato drain for a few minutes in a strainer).\n\nIn a large bowl, coarsely mash the flesh of 3 ripe avocados (together they should weigh 1 to 1 ¼ pounds before they’re cut): cut the avocados in half around the pit from top to bottom and back up again, twist the halves in opposite directions, pull them apart, scoop out the pits, scoop the flesh from each half). The mashing implement is important: to create thick, “meaty” guacamole, use a large fork or old-fashioned potato or bean masher. \n\nGently stir in the vegetables, remembering that you don’t have to use them all if it looks like they’re going to take focus away from the avocado. Taste what you have, then **start the restrained addition of lime**:  it usually takes a tablespoon or two of fresh-squeezed lime juice to heighten the avocado flavor without screaming “lime juice!” I can assure you that it’ll take about 1 teaspoon salt to harmonize the avocado with the other flavors—any less will leave the avocado flavor wandering in the wilderness.",

    "directions": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nWe prefer to use a cast-iron skillet here because it makes the best crust; however, any 10-inch ovensafe skillet will work for this recipe. Cornbread is best served warm.\n\nAdjust oven racks to lower-middle and middle positions and heat oven to 450 degrees. Place 10-inch cast-iron skillet on middle rack and heat for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, spread cornmeal over rimmed baking sheet and toast in oven on lower-middle rack until fragrant and lightly golden, about 5 minutes.\n\nCarefully transfer toasted cornmeal to large bowl and whisk in sour cream and milk; set aside. When skillet is hot, add oil and continue to heat until just smoking, about 5 minutes.\n\nUsing potholders (skillet handle will be hot), remove skillet from oven, carefully add butter, and gently swirl to incorporate. Pour hot oil-butter mixture into cornmeal mixture and whisk to incorporate. Whisk in sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt, followed by eggs.\n\nQuickly scrape batter into hot skillet and smooth top. Bake on middle rack until top begins to crack and sides are golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes, rotating skillet halfway through baking. Let bread cool in skillet on wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove bread from pan and let cool on rack for at least 10 minutes before serving.",

    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nBuffalo wings are a messy finger food but a definite crowd-pleaser. To make a more party-friendly version, we turned them into a dip with all the same lip-tingling, tangy flavor but with easier access and less mess. Shredding the meat from a rotisserie chicken kept the dip quick to assemble. Cream cheese provided a smooth base for the dip, and microwaving it with Frank’s RedHot Original Cayenne Pepper Sauce loosened it so that stirring in chunky ingredients (chicken and blue cheese) was a snap. A cup of ranch dressing, a couple of teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, and a sprinkling of cheddar cheese and scallions heightened the dip’s zesty tang.",

    "name": "Slow-Cooker Chicken Chasseur",
    "ingredients": "8 ounces bacon (about 8 slices), chopped fine\n12 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (5 to 6 ounces each), trimmed of any yellow or white fat (see note)\nSalt and ground black pepper\nVegetable oil, as needed\n1 1/4 pounds cremini mushrooms, wiped clean and quartered (see note)\n1 medium red onion, chopped medium\n4 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 4 teaspoons)\n1 1/2 cups dry white wine\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n1 (14.5-ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained\n2 cups low-sodium chicken broth\n1/4 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, rinsed and minced\n1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves or 1 teaspoon dried\n2 bay leaves\n1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup minced fresh parsley leaves",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: A successful slow-cooker chicken chasseur recipe required that the chicken, vegetables, and flavorings be browned on the stovetop before they were transferred to the slow cooker to simmer. We found that about four hours on the cooker’s lowest setting produced the best results. For our slow-cooker chicken chasseur recipe, bone-in, skin-on thighs tasted best, though we did find it important to remove the skin once the pieces were browned (when they were left on, the broth turned greasy). \n\nChicken chasseur is a simple, peasant-style braise enriched by the deep, woodsy flavors of mushrooms and bacon. If cremini mushrooms (aka baby bellas) are unavailable, substitute portobello mushroom caps, cut into 1-inch pieces. Although we prefer the texture and flavor of chicken thighs here, you can substitute 6 bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts; the cooking time will remain the same, but the meat will be a bit drier. This dish is great served with pasta, polenta, or a loaf of crusty bread.\n\n1. Cook the bacon in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat until crisp, about 8 minutes. Add the bacon to the slow cooker, leaving the bacon fat in the pan.\n\n2. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Pour off all but 2 tablespoons fat from the pan (add vegetable oil to equal 2 tablespoons if needed) and heat over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown half of the chicken on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side, reducing the heat if the pan begins to scorch. Transfer the chicken to a plate, leaving the fat in the pan. When cool enough to handle, remove the browned skin from the thighs and discard. Transfer the chicken to the slow cooker. Return the pan with the fat to medium-high heat and repeat with the remaining half of the chicken.\n\n3. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from the pan. (Add additional vegetable oil to equal 1 tablespoon if needed.) Add the cremini mushrooms, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the pan, cover, and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have released their liquid, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the wine and tomato paste, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer until reduced by half, about 5 minutes. Pour into the slow cooker.\n\n4. Add the tomatoes, 1 1/2 cups of the broth, the porcini mushrooms, thyme, bay leaves, and pepper flakes to the slow cooker. Cover and cook on low until the chicken is tender, about 4 hours.\n\n5. Transfer the chicken to a large serving dish and tent loosely with foil. Discard the bay leaves. Set the slow cooker to high. Whisk the remaining 1/2 cup broth and the flour together until smooth, then stir into the slow cooker. Cover and continue to cook until the sauce is thickened and no longer tastes of flour, 15 to 30 minutes longer.\n\n6. Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the vegetables and some of the sauce over the chicken and serve, passing the remaining sauce separately.",

    "ingredients": "1 1/2 pounds 93 percent lean ground beef\n2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons water\nSalt and pepper\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n1/2 cup milk\n1 large egg yolk\n8 scallions, green parts only, sliced thin\n2 teaspoons vegetable oil\n1 onion, chopped\n4 ounces white mushrooms, trimmed and chopped\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n2 tablespoons Madeira or ruby port\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1 1/4 cups beef broth\n2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\n2 sprigs fresh thyme\n1 bay leaf\n2 carrots, peeled and chopped\n2 teaspoons cornstarch",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: The traditional version of this dish of meat and gravy topped with mashed potatoes is time-consuming to make, and the end product is a bit heavy for modern palates. We streamlined the process by building and serving the pie in one skillet and by using lean ground beef rather than braised chunks of meat. To keep the meat tender, we treated it with baking soda, which raised the pH and kept the proteins from bonding too tightly, and we simmered the meat in the gravy rather than seared it. To replace the browned meat flavors that usually form the basis of the sauce, we sautéed the onions, mushrooms, and tomato paste in the skillet until quite dark, and then we deglazed the pan with fortified wine.\n\n1. Toss beef with 2 tablespoons water, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and baking soda in bowl until thoroughly combined. Set aside for 20 minutes.\n2. Meanwhile, place potatoes in medium saucepan; add water to just cover and 1 tablespoon salt. Bring to boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are soft and tip of paring knife inserted into potato meets no resistance, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain potatoes and return to saucepan. Return saucepan to low heat and cook, shaking pot occasionally, until any surface moisture on potatoes has evaporated, about 1 minute. Remove pan from heat and mash potatoes well. Stir in melted butter. Whisk together milk and egg yolk in small bowl, then stir into potatoes. Stir in scallion greens and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cover and set aside.\n3. Heat oil in broiler-safe 10-inch skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion, mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are just starting to soften and dark bits form on bottom of skillet, 4 to 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and garlic; cook until bottom of skillet is dark brown, about 2 minutes. Add Madeira and cook, scraping up any browned bits, until evaporated, about 1 minute. Stir in flour and cook for 1 minute. Add broth, Worcestershire, thyme, bay leaf, and carrots; bring to boil, scraping up any browned bits. Reduce heat to medium-low, add beef in 2-inch chunks to broth, and bring to gentle simmer. Cover and cook until beef is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes, stirring and breaking up meat chunks with 2 forks halfway through. Stir cornstarch and remaining 2 teaspoons water together in bowl. Stir cornstarch mixture into filling and continue to simmer for 30 seconds. Remove thyme and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n4. Adjust oven rack 5 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Place mashed potatoes in large zipper-lock bag and snip off 1 corner to create 1-inch opening. Pipe potatoes in even layer over filling, making sure to cover entire surface. Smooth potatoes with back of spoon, then use tines of fork to make ridges over surface. Place skillet on rimmed baking sheet and broil until potatoes are golden brown and crusty and filling is bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.",

    "ingredients": "2 lb. baby Yukon Gold or Red Bliss potatoes (20 to 25 potatoes, 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 inches in diameter)\n1 sprig fresh rosemary\n2 cups homemade or low-salt chicken broth\n2 Tbs. good-quality extra-virgin olive oil\n1 Tbs. unsalted butter\n1 teaspoon kosher salt (less if the broth is salty)\n1 to 2 Tbs. thinly sliced fresh chives\nFleur de sel or other sea salt for serving (optional)",
    "directions": "Trim the potatoes of any eyes or damaged areas and wash well in cold water. Arrange as many potatoes as will fit in one layer in a 10-inch nonstick skillet (there should be a little room to spare; save any extra potatoes for another use). Add the rosemary, broth, oil, butter, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, cover the pan but leave the lid a tad ajar, and boil until the potatoes are tender when pierced with a fork, **about 20 min**. The liquid should still halfway surround the potatoes; if it doesn’t, add more broth or water until it does\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and press on each potato with a 1/4-cup measure just until it cracks open. Set the pan over **medium-high heat** and cook, uncovered, until all the liquid has evaporated and the potatoes have browned on one side, about 10 min. Gently turn the potatoes and brown the other side, another 4 to 5 min.\n\nPress firmly on the potatoes to crack them; this helps them absorb more broth and ensures a creamy, moist interior. Then continue boiling, but now uncovered.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and let the potatoes rest for 5 min. before transferring them to a serving platter. Sprinkle with the chives and serve immediately, passing the fleur de sel so diners can sprinkle some on if they want.",

    "directions": "In a small bowl, whisk the lemon zest, lemon juice, honey, and 1/4 cup of olive oil. Add the garlic cloves and let them steep for about 30 minutes. \n\nNext, bring the veggie stock to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in the couscous, cover, and turn off the heat; allow the couscous to sit for about 5 minutes, or until it absorbs all the liquid. Toss the couscous with a fork so the grains don’t start clumping together, pour into a large mixing bowl, and set aside. \n\nIn a skillet over medium high heat, add about 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Then, add the chopped squash and zucchini, shallot, sultanas, pistachios and a pinch or two of salt. Only cook for about a minute or two — you still want the squash and zucchini to be al dente. This just ensures they aren’t too al dente, and all the flavors can marry before they hit the couscous. Set aside until everything reaches room temperature. \n\nOnce the veggies have reached room temperature, add them to the bowl with the couscous and combine.\n\nThen, remove and discard the cloves of garlic from the dressing, and toss it with the couscous (add the dressing gradually, as you may not need it all). Fold in the mint, season with additional salt and pepper if necessary and serve at room temperature.\n\n",

We built in flavor from the beginning by toasting our garlic low and slow until the natural sugars created sticky, almost candy-like flavor. When the pasta was nearly ready, we uncovered the skillet and reduced the liquid, which melded with the starch from the pasta resulting in a luscious sauce that coated the noodles perfectly. Lots of lemon, savory Parmesan, and crunchy pine nuts transformed this quick weeknight meal into a sophisticated dish you’ll be making time and time again.",

    "ingredients": "1 cup best-quality red wine vinegar \n2 to 3 garlic cloves, minced (about 2 tablespoons) \n3 sprigs of fresh rosemary, chopped (about 1 tablespoon)\n5 1/2 pounds bone-in chicken pieces (each part should be cut in half) Coarse salt and freshly ground black pepper \nExtra-virgin olive oil \n3 1/4 cup chicken broth, plus more as needed\n",
    "directions": "At least 15 minutes but up to 2 hours before cooking, combine the vinegar, garlic, and rosemary to marinate.\n\n2. Thoroughly season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper. Heat a 14-inch skillet (or two smaller skillets) over high heat and swirl in enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the skillet. \n\n3. Place the chicken in the skillet, skin side down. Don't crowd the chicken; leave space around each piece. Work in batches if necessary. You should hear an immediate sizzle when the chicken pieces hit the pan. Don't move them; it takes a couple minutes to sear the chicken so it doesn't stick. Brown all sides; this will take 10 minutes per batch. Regulate the heat so it stays high but does not burn the chicken.\n\n4. Place all the browned chicken back in the skillet.\n\n5. Add the chicken broth and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan.\nLower the heat, simmer, and reduce for 15 to 20 minutes. \n\n6. Increase the heat to high and pour in the vinegar mixture. Swirl the pan and stir around as the vinegar evaporates to form a simmering glaze, 8 to 10 minutes.\n\nServe immediately or reheat with some extra broth. \n\nPolenta\nA staple of northern Italian cooking, polenta is boiled cornmeal It's traditionally slow-cooked and requires constant stirring But the modern-style instant polenta that's readily available at grocery stores works better for time-pressed home cooking Once cooked, polenta firms up as it cools, so it can be shaped or molded and then sliced and reheated at mealtime Pour the loose hot polenta into a greased loaf pan, smooth the top with a spoon, cover, and chill. When ready to serve, slice the polenta, panfry the shoes in olive oil or warm them in the oven or microwave.The hot polenta also can be poured into a greased rimmed baking sheet, spread evenly, covered, and chilled. When it is set, it can be cut into shapes with round, square, or diamond shaped biscuit cutters Many stores also carry a pre-made log of polenta, in the dairy case, ready to be sliced and heated\n\n",

    "directions": "In a blender, combine the shredded coconut and warm water. Let stand until the coconut begins to soften, about 5 minutes. Blend on high until creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the mixture into a fine-mesh sieve set over a large saucepan. Press on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible; discard the solids.\n\nUsing a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from the limes in strips; remove only the colored portion, not the white pith beneath. You will need a total of about 10 strips, each 2 to 3 inches long; add them to the saucepan. Juice the limes; you will need 3 tablespoons; set aside.\n\nTo the saucepan, add the coconut cream, coconut water, lemon grass, ginger, shallot, turmeric, ½ teaspoon salt and ¼ teaspoon white pepper. Bring to a simmer over medium-high, then reduce to low and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, for 20 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard the solids.\n\nFor oyster mushrooms, tear them into bite-size pieces. For shiitakes, stem and thinly slice them. Stir the mushrooms, then bring to a simmer over medium. Add the chicken, fish sauce, chili paste, sugar and ⅛ teaspoon white pepper. Simmer, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until the chicken is opaque throughout and the mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Off heat, stir in the lime juice and sliced chili. Taste and season with salt or fish sauce and white pepper. Serve sprinkled with cilantro.",

Mix all ingredients together in bowl.\n\n4) Let bean/grain mixture rest for about 15-20 minutes before forming into patties. Roll mixture into 2 1/2- to 3-oz balls (a little less than 1/4 cup) and flatten into 1/2-inch-thick patties.\n\n5) Pan cook in a teeny bit of oil or cooking spray for 5–7 minutes on each side; or bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, turning after 15 minutes. Either way, the outside gets a little crispy and the inside is nice and chewy, but not dry.\n\n6) Serve with whole grain bread and your favorite condiments, like spicy mustard or peanut butter and American cheese. These burgers rock with sweet potato fries.\n\n",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "Examine mussels before using. If they're gritty or have lots of beards (it'll look like bits of hair coming out from between their shells), scrub them well under cold water and pull out the beards by grabbing them and pulling towards the hinge-end of the mussels. Farm-raised mussels are generally quite clean when they are sold.\n\nDiscard cracked mussels or open mussels that don't close when tapped with another mussel.\n\nMayonnaise is not essential for this dish, but it does add extra richness and lots of flavor, particularly if served alongside for dipping mussels into. When using mayonnaise for this dish, be sure to use fresh homemade mayonnaise—store-bought mayonnaise will not combine with the sauce properly. I like to add extra garlic and substitute half of the canola oil for extra-virgin olive oil when making mayonnaise for mussels.",

    "name": "Smothered Pork Chops",
    "ingredients": "1 teaspoon onion powder\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\nSalt and pepper\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n4 bone-in blade-cut pork chops, about 1/2 inch thick\n1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter\n2 onions, halved and sliced 1/4 inch thick\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n1/4 teaspoon dried thyme\n3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon beef broth\n1 bay leaf\n1 teaspoon cornstarch\n1 teaspoon cider vinegar",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Bone-in chops were a must for our Smothered Pork Chops, because the bone kept the meat moist and added flavor to the sauce. After a number of tests, we settled on blade chops. Caramelizing the onions made the sauce too sweet and took almost an hour. We had better luck cooking them in butter until they were lightly browned. We swapped out chicken broth in favor of meatier beef broth, which greatly improved the flavor of our sauce. Adding dried thyme, bay leaf, and cider vinegar bumped up the flavor even more.\n\n1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Combine onion powder, paprika, ½ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon pepper, and cayenne in small bowl. Pat chops dry with paper towels and rub with spice mixture.\n\n2. Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown chops, 3 to 4 minutes per side, and transfer to plate. Melt butter in now-empty skillet over medium heat. Cook onions until browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in ¾ cup broth and bay leaf, scraping up any browned bits, and bring to boil. Return chops and any accumulated juices to pan, cover, and transfer to oven. Cook until chops are completely tender, about 1½ hours.\n\n3. Transfer chops to platter and tent with foil. Discard bay leaf. Strain contents of skillet through fine mesh strainer into large liquid measuring cup; reserve onions. Let liquid settle, then skim fat. Return 1½ cups defatted pan juices to now-empty skillet and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce is reduced to 1 cup, about 5 minutes.\n\n4. Whisk remaining broth and cornstarch in bowl until no lumps remain. Whisk cornstarch mixture into sauce and simmer until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in reserved onions and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Serve.",

    "name": "Red Tomato Rice",
    "ingredients": "1 15-ounce can diced tomatoes (I prefer fire-roasted), lightly drained OR 12 ounces (2 medium-small round or 4 to 6 plum) very ripe tomatoes, cored and roughly chopped\n1/2 small white onion, roughly chopped\n2 garlic cloves, peeled and halved\n1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n1 1/2 cups white rice, preferably medium-grain\n1 3/4 cups chicken broth or water\nFresh hot green chile to taste (roughly 3 serranos or 2 jalapeños), a slit cut down the length of each one\nAbout 1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh parsley\nsalt",
    "directions": "Make the tomato flavoring. In a blender or food processor, combine the tomatoes (drained canned or chopped raw) with the onion and garlic. Blend to a smooth puree.\n\nFry the raw rice. In a medium (3-quart) saucepan with a tight fitting lid (one that’s about 8 inches in diameter is perfect for even cooking), heat the oil over medium. Add the raw rice and stir frequently until the kernels have turned from translucent to milky white, 5 to 6 minutes—it is fine for some browning to take place. Add the tomato mixture, stir around a couple of times, then let cook until reduced and somewhat dry-looking, 2 to 3 minutes.\n\nSimmer the rice. Add the broth or water, bring to a full boil, then add the chiles, parsley and the salt, about ¾ teaspoon if using lightly salted broth, 1½ teaspoons if using unsalted broth or water. Stir thoroughly, scraping down any rice kernels clinging to the side of the pan. Cover and cook over lowest heat for 17 minutes—the temperature should be low enough that only the slightest hint of steam escapes from the lid. At 17 minutes, the rice should be tender. Use a fork to gently fluff the rice to release the steam and stop the cooking. Recover and let stand a few minutes longer for the starch in the rice to firm. You’re ready to serve. You may remove the chiles if you wish, or pull them out to use as decoration on top of the rice.",

    "ingredients": "2 1/4 pounds (1kg) Yukon Gold potatoes\nKosher salt\n3 fresh thyme sprigs\n1/4 pound (115g) slab or thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/4-inch lardons\n1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30g) unsalted butter, only if needed\n2 medium (8-ounce; 225g) yellow onions, thinly sliced\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 cup (120ml) dry white wine\n1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream or crème fraîche\n1 pound (450g) Reblochon-style soft-rind cheese (see headnote for suggested cheeses)",
    "directions": "Peel potatoes and cut into 1/2-inch thick rounds. In a large pot, cover potatoes with cold water. Season generously with salt, add thyme, and bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Cook at a bare simmer until potatoes are just tender and can be easily pierced with a paring knife, about 25 minutes. Discard thyme, drain potatoes, return to pot, and set aside.\n\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). In a 10-inch cast iron or stainless-steel skillet, heat bacon over medium-high heat until fat begins to render. Lower heat to medium and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until fat is mostly rendered and bacon is cooked but not crisp, about 5 minutes. If there is excessive rendered fat, drain off all but 1/4 cup (60ml); conversely, if the bacon is lean and didn't release much fat, add 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30g) butter. Add onions, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until onions have softened but not browned, about 8 minutes.\n\nAdd white wine and cook, stirring, until wine has almost fully cooked off, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape bacon-onion mixture into pot with potatoes and toss gently to thoroughly combine.\n\nScrape potato mixture back into cast-iron skillet or into a 3-quart (3L) baking dish. Add cream or crème fraîche (the latter is thicker, so you can dollop it around in that case).\n\nCut cheese into roughly 1/2-inch-thick slabs. You can do this by cutting the cheese wheels in half to make half-moons; halve wheels through the equator; or slice crosswise into thick planks. Arrange cheese on top of potatoes, rind side up. Set skillet or baking dish on top of a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling and lightly browned on top, about 40 minutes.\n\nServe, scooping tartiflette from the skillet or baking dish onto individual serving plates.",

    "directions": "Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 500 degrees. Grease a rimmed baking sheet with the appropriate oil and place the trout on the sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart. Season the cavity of each fish with salt and pepper. Using a spoon, divide the filling equally among the cavities of the fish.\n\nPlace the baking sheet in the oven and cook until the fish is opaque and the meat flakes upon touch, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve immediately, 1 trout per diner, garnished with a lemon wedge.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "The filling may be made up to 2 days ahead of time, but the fish should be stuffed and roasted at the last minute. With either filling, the trout pairs well with the bulgur and quinoa pilafs. Use olive oil to grease the baking sheet if using the fennel stuffing; vegetable oil works better with the bacon stuffing. Ask your fishmonger to gut and clean the fish.",

    "name": "Chocolate-Espresso Dacquoise",
    "ingredients": "**MERINGUE**\n¾ cup blanched sliced almonds, toasted\n½ cup hazelnuts, toasted and skinned\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n⅛ teaspoon salt\n1 cup (7 ounces) sugar\n4 large egg whites, room temperature\n¼ teaspoon cream of tartar\n\n**BUTTERCREAM**\n¾ cup whole milk\n4 large egg yolks\n⅓ cup (2 1/3 ounces) sugar\n1 ½ teaspoons cornstarch\n¼ teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons amaretto or water\n1 ½ tablespoons instant espresso powder\n16 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n\n**GANACHE**\n6 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine\n¾ cup heavy cream\n2 teaspoons corn syrup\n12 whole hazelnuts, toasted and skinned\n1 cup blanched sliced almonds, toasted",
    "directions": "1. FOR THE MERINGUE: Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 250 degrees. Using ruler and pencil, draw 13 by 10 1/2-inch rectangle on piece of parchment paper. Grease baking sheet and place parchment on it, ink side down.\n\n2. Process almonds, hazelnuts, cornstarch, and salt in food processor until nuts are finely ground, 15 to 20 seconds. Add 1/2 cup sugar and pulse to combine, 1 to 2 pulses.\n\n3. Using stand mixer fitted with whisk, whip egg whites and cream of tartar on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute. Increase speed to medium-high and whip whites to soft, billowy mounds, about 1 minute. With mixer running at medium-high speed, slowly add remaining 1/2 cup sugar and continue to whip until glossy, stiff peaks form, 2 to 3 minutes. Fold nut mixture into egg whites in 2 batches. With offset spatula, spread meringue evenly into 13 by 10 1/2-inch rectangle on parchment, using lines on parchment as guide. Using spray bottle, evenly mist surface of meringue with water until glistening. Bake for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off oven and allow meringue to cool in oven for 1 1/2 hours. (Do not open oven during baking and cooling.) Remove from oven and let cool to room temperature, about 10 minutes. (Cooled meringue can be kept at room temperature, tightly wrapped in plastic wrap, for up to 2 days.)\n\n4. FOR THE BUTTERCREAM: Heat milk in small saucepan over medium heat until just simmering. Meanwhile, whisk yolks, sugar, cornstarch, and salt in bowl until smooth. Remove milk from heat and, whisking constantly, add half of milk to yolk mixture to temper. Whisking constantly, return tempered yolk mixture to remaining milk in saucepan. Return saucepan to medium heat and cook, whisking constantly, until mixture is bubbling and thickens to consistency of warm pudding, 3 to 5 minutes. Transfer pastry cream to bowl. Cover and refrigerate until set, at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Before using, warm gently to room temperature in microwave at 50 percent power, stirring every 10 seconds.\n\n5. Stir together amaretto and espresso powder; set aside. Using stand mixer fitted with paddle, beat butter at medium speed until smooth and light, 3 to 4 minutes. Add pastry cream in 3 batches, beating for 30 seconds after each addition. Add amaretto mixture and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes longer, scraping down bowl thoroughly halfway through mixing.\n\n6. FOR THE GANACHE: Place chocolate in heatproof bowl. Bring cream and corn syrup to simmer in small saucepan over medium heat. Pour cream mixture over chocolate and let stand for 1 minute. Stir mixture until smooth. Set aside to cool until chocolate mounds slightly when dripped from spoon, about 5 minutes.\n\n7. Carefully invert meringue and peel off parchment. Reinvert meringue and place on cutting board. Using serrated knife and gentle, repeated scoring motion, trim edges of meringue to form 12 by 10-inch rectangle. Discard trimmings. With long side of rectangle parallel to counter, use ruler to mark both long edges of meringue at 3-inch intervals. Using serrated knife, score surface of meringue by drawing knife toward you from mark on top edge to corresponding mark on bottom edge. Repeat scoring until meringue is fully cut through. Repeat until you have four 10 by 3-inch rectangles. (If any meringues break during cutting, use them as middle layers.)\n\n8. Place 3 rectangles on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet. Using offset spatula, spread 1/4 cup ganache evenly over surface of each meringue. Refrigerate until ganache is firm, about 15 minutes. Set aside remaining ganache.\n\n9. Using offset spatula, spread top of remaining rectangle with 1/2 cup buttercream; place on wire rack with ganache-coated meringues. Invert 1 ganache-coated meringue, place on top of buttercream, and press gently to level. Repeat, spreading meringue with 1/2 cup buttercream and topping with inverted ganache-coated meringue. Spread top with buttercream. Invert final ganache-coated strip on top of cake. Use 1 hand to steady top of cake and spread half of remaining buttercream to lightly coat sides of cake, then use remaining buttercream to coat top of cake. Smooth until cake resembles box. Refrigerate until buttercream is firm, about 2 hours. (Once buttercream is firm, assembled cake may be wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days.)\n\n10. Warm remaining ganache in heatproof bowl set over barely simmering water, stirring occasionally, until mixture is very fluid but not hot. Keeping assembled cake on wire rack, pour ganache over top of cake. Using offset spatula, spread ganache in thin, even layer over top of cake, letting excess flow down sides. Spread ganache over sides in thin layer (top must be completely covered, but some small gaps on sides are OK).\n\n11. Garnish top of cake with hazelnuts. Holding bottom of cake with 1 hand, gently press almonds onto sides with other hand. Chill on wire rack, uncovered, for at least 3 hours or up to 12 hours. Transfer to platter. Cut into slices with sharp knife that has been dipped in hot water and wiped dry before each slice. Serve.",
    "description": "We made this elaborate and impressive-looking dessert more approachable by reworking the meringue and buttercream, making them simpler and more foolproof. We swapped the traditional individually piped layers of meringue for a single sheet that was trimmed into layers after baking, and we shortened the usual 4-plus hours of oven time by increasing the oven temperature. While many recipes call for a Swiss or French buttercream made with a hot sugar syrup, we opted for a German buttercream. With equal parts pastry cream and butter, this option required no hot syrup and it enabled us to use up the egg yolks left over from the meringue.",

    "ingredients": "2 (1-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1 ¼ teaspoons vegetable oil\n½ teaspoon pepper\n¼ teaspoon baking soda\n1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum roasting pan",
    "directions": "\nWe prefer natural pork, but if you use enhanced pork (injected with a salt solution), reduce the salt in step 2 to 1 1/2 teaspoons. A 3-inch-deep aluminum roasting pan is essential. Do not attempt this recipe with a drawer broiler. We set the rack 4 to 5 inches from the element for the best results for this recipe.\n\n1. Adjust oven rack 4 to 5 inches from broiler element and heat oven to 325 degrees. Fold thin tip of each tenderloin under about 2 inches to create uniformly shaped roast. Tie tenderloins crosswise with kitchen twine at 2-inch intervals, making sure folded tip is secured underneath. Trim excess twine close to meat to prevent it from scorching under broiler.\n\n2. Mix salt, oil, and pepper in small bowl until salt is evenly coated with oil. Add baking soda and stir until well combined. Rub mixture evenly over pork. Place tenderloins in disposable pan, evenly spaced between sides of pan and each other.\n\n3. Turn oven to broil. Immediately place meat in oven and broil tenderloins for 5 minutes. Flip tenderloins and continue to broil until golden brown and meat registers 125 to 130 degrees, 8 to 14 minutes. Remove disposable pan from oven, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Remove twine, slice tenderloins into 1/2-inch-thick slices, and serve.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nRecipes for broiled pork tenderloin promise roasts with well-browned exteriors and rosy-pink, juicy centers, but the results are more likely pallid, overcooked meat or spottily browned roasts with undercooked interiors. Using a disposable aluminum pan to cook the pork reflected the radiant heat of the broiler toward the pork, enhancing browning and ensuring that the interior didn’t overcook by the time deep browning had been achieved. Since some ovens preheat faster than others and are likely to cycle off if preheated at such an intense heat for too long, we evened the playing field by preheating the oven to 325 degrees before putting in the roasts and turning on the broiler. And finally, because of the broiler’s intense heat, we found that there was a much bigger carryover cooking effect, so we pulled the roasts from the oven when they hit 125 to 130 degrees instead of our usual 140 degrees to ensure that they were a perfect medium-rare after their 10-minute rest.",

    "directions": "Adjust rack to center position and heat oven to 450.°\n\nMix first 3 ingredients in a large bowl or the workbowl of a food processor fitted with steel blade. Add butter; with your fingertips, a pastry blender, 2 knives, or steel blade of a food processor, mix, cut, or process butter and shortening into dry ingredients, until the mixture resembles dry oatmeal. (Transfer food processor mixture to a large bowl.)\n\nStir in milk with a rubber spatula or fork until dry ingredients are just moistened. Let dough rest for 1 minute, then transfer it to a well-floured work surface.\n\nRoll the dough into a rough 6-by-10-inch rectangle. With the long edge of the dough facing you, fold in both short ends of the dough so that they meet in the center; then fold the dough in half by width, forming a package of dough four layers thick. Once again, roll the dough into a 6-by-10-inch rectangle 1/2-inch thick.\n\nUsing a lightly greased and floured 2-inch cutter, stamp, with one decisive punch per round, 4 rows of 3 dough rounds, cutting them close together to generate as few scraps as possible. Dip cutter into flour before each new cut. Push the scraps of dough together so that their edges join; firmly pinch the edges with fingertips to make a partial seal. Pat the dough into small rectangle, fold it as before, and re-roll 1/2-inch thick. Cut out 3 or 4 more biscuits.\n\nPlace dough rounds 1 1/2 inches apart on an ungreased baking sheet; brush dough tops with melted butter or milk. (May be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated up to 3 hours.)\n\nBake until biscuits are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Serve immediately.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "After stirring in the milk, this dough should feel very soft and moist, but you should be able to hold it briefly between lightly floured hands without its sticking. If it turns out wet and sticky, return it to the bowl and sprinkle it with 2 to 4 tablespoons additional flour (of any kind) on all sides, gently patting in the flour with your palm. Let the dough rest another half-minute before removing it to your work surface. It is best to discard the dough that is left over from the second cutting, as biscuits made with thrice-recycled dough tend to be tough and flat. These biscuits are best served at once, though leftovers may be wrapped and refrigerated for a day, then reheated for a few minutes in a 350° oven.",

    "name": "Brazilian Style Rib Roast Stuffed with Sausage and Cheese",
    "ingredients": "\n\n\n",
    "directions": "Using a long slender carving knife, make a 1-inch lengthwise cut through the center of the roast.  Cut one end off two of the chorizos.  Cut both ends off the third chorizo.  Insert the chorizos into the hole you’ve made in the roast, butting the ends of the sausages so they fit snugly.  (Insert the uncut end of chorizo first, followed by the chorizo with two cuts, and lastly, insert the third chorizo, cut end first.)\n\nUsing a sharpening steel (wipe it with a paper towel before using),\n\nmake lengthwise tunnels through the roast around the sausage and insert the carrots and cheese strips.  You may need to insert more than  1 strip of cheese per tunnel.  Cut off the ends of the sausages, carrots, and cheese, leaving 1/2-inch protruding.\n\nMake the rub: Combine the paprika, salt, cumin, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper in a small bowl and stir to mix.  Sprinkle this mixture all over the roast, rubbing it onto the meat with your fingers.  Let the roast sit while you preheat the grill.\n\nSkewer the roast on the spit (remember to put the first set of prongs on first), tightening the prongs to hold it securely.\n\n(Use the tines of a fork to tighten the flat screw on the prongs.)\n\nSet up the grill for rotisserie grilling following the manufacturer’s instructions and preheat to medium-high.  Place a large drip pan underneath the spit to catch the meat drippings.  When ready to cook, attach the spit to the rotisserie motor mechanism by inserting the pointed end of the spit into the rotisserie’s motor socket.  If your rotisserie spit has a counterweight, position it so that it counterbalances the roast.  Turn on the motor and spit roast the rib roast until the outside is crusty and handsomely browned and the inside is cooked to taste, about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 hours for medium-rare.  An instant-read meat thermometer should read about 145 degrees.\n\nCarefully remove the roast from the spit and transfer to a carving board.  Let the meat rest for 10 minutes before thinly slicing it crosswise with a sharp carving knife.  (Makes sure each slice includes a piece of chorizo.)\n\n",

Refrigerate at least 30 minutes. (Can be refrigerated up to 3 days ahead.)\n\nIn 5-quart pot or Dutch oven fitted with clip-on-the-pot candy thermometer, or in larger electric fryer, heat oil over medium-low heat to 325 degrees. As oil heats, add bacon grease. Oil will bubble up when you add fries, so be sure you have at least 3 inches of room at top of cooking pot.\n\nPour off ice and water, quickly wrap potatoes in a clean tea towel, and thoroughly pat dry. Increase heat to medium-high and add fries, a handful at a time, to hot oil. Fry, stirring with Chinese skimmer or large-hole slotted spoon, until potatoes are limp and soft and start to turn from white to blond, 6 to 8 minutes. (Oil temperature will drop 50 to 60 degrees during this frying.) Use skimmer or slotted spoon to transfer fries to brown paper bag to drain; let rest at least 10 minutes (can stand at room temperature up to 2 hours or be wrapped in paper towels, sealed in zipper-lock bag, and frozen up to 1 month).\n\nWhen ready to serve fries, reheat oil to 350 degrees. Using paper bag as a funnel, pour potatoes into hot oil. Discard bag and set up second paper bag. Fry potatoes, stirring fairly constantly, until golden brown and puffed, about 1 minute. Transfer to paper bag and drain again. Season to taste with salt and pepper, or other seasoned salt. Serve immediately.",

    "name": "Tender, Juicy Grilled Burgers",
    "ingredients": "1 ½ pounds sirloin steak tips, trimmed and cut into 1/2-inch chunks\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into 1/4-inch pieces\nKosher salt and pepper\n1 (13 by 9-inch) disposable aluminum pan (if using charcoal)\n4 hamburger buns",
    "directions": "This recipe requires freezing the meat twice, for a total of 65 to 80 minutes, before grilling. When stirring the salt and pepper into the ground meat and shaping the patties, take care not to overwork the meat or the burgers will become dense. Sirloin steak tips are also sold as flap meat. Serve the burgers with your favorite toppings or one of our grilled-vegetable toppings (see related content).\n\n1. Place beef chunks and butter on large plate in single layer. Freeze until meat is very firm and starting to harden around edges but still pliable, about 35 minutes.\n\n2. Place one-quarter of meat and one-quarter of butter cubes in food processor and pulse until finely ground into pieces size of rice grains (about 1/32 inch), 15 to 20 pulses, stopping and redistributing meat around bowl as necessary to ensure beef is evenly ground. Transfer meat to baking sheet. Repeat grinding with remaining 3 batches of meat and butter. Spread mixture over sheet and inspect carefully, discarding any long strands of gristle or large chunks of hard meat, fat, or butter.\n\n3. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon pepper and 3/4 teaspoon salt over meat and gently toss with fork to combine. Divide meat into 4 balls. Toss each between hands until uniformly but lightly packed. Gently flatten into patties 3/4 inch thick and about 4 1/2 inches in diameter. Using thumb, make 1-inch-wide by 1/4-inch-deep depression in center of each patty. Transfer patties to platter and freeze for 30 to 45 minutes.\n\n4A. FOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Using skewer, poke 12 holes in bottom of disposable pan. Open bottom vent completely and place disposable pan in center of grill. Light large chimney starter filled two-thirds with charcoal briquettes (4 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour into disposable pan. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\n4B. FOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave all burners on high.\n\n5. Clean and oil cooking grate. Season 1 side of patties liberally with salt and pepper. Using spatula, flip patties and season other side. Grill patties (directly over coals if using charcoal), without moving them, until browned and meat easily releases from grill, 4 to 7 minutes. Flip burgers and continue to grill until browned on second side and meat registers 125 degrees for medium-rare or 130 degrees for medium, 4 to 7 minutes longer.\n\n6. Transfer burgers to plate and let rest for 5 minutes. While burgers rest, lightly toast buns on grill, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer burgers to buns and serve.\n\nAdd Salt for Juicier Burgers\n\nMixing ground meat with too much salt will make burgers tough, but 3/4 teaspoon helps the meat retain its juices.",

Stir in salt, cumin, baking powder and flour until well-mixed., but not really a dough.\n\n4) Stick it in the fridge, covered, for anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours. The longer the better. (I did it for an hour, and turned out nicely.)\n\n5) With your hands, make small falafel hockey pucks about 1 to 1-1/2 inches in diameter and ¾ of an inch high. (The flat surface will help with the frying.)\n\n6) Turn oven to 400ºF.\n\n7) Heat 2 Tbsp vegetable oil in a huge ovenproof skillet on medium-high. Fry the pucks for about 3 minutes on the first side, and 2 minutes on the second, until they’re golden brown.\n\n8) When finished, stick skillet in oven (or transfer pucks to a Pam-ed aluminum foil lined cookie sheet) and bake for 10-12 minutes.\n\n9) Stick four balls in half a pita with tomatoes, green pepper, and onions. Drizzle with tahini sauce (recipe below).\n\n",

    "name": "Cinnamon Cloudcakes Pancakes",
    "ingredients": "1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n3 tablespoons sugar\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n3/4 teaspoon table salt\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1 1/4 cups low-fat buttermilk(see headnote)\n1/4 cup sour cream\n2 large eggs, separated, plus 2 extra egg whites\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled\n1 - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil",
    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: One of our favorite pancake recipes is Cloudcakes. This recipe creates light-as-air pancakes with a tangy kick. Cloudcakes get their airy texture when the eggs are separated and the whites are beaten into a stiff foam. We used a rubber spatula to gently fold the whites into the other ingredients, and were careful not to deflate them. To create an even lighter texture in our Cloudcakes recipe, we added two egg whites to two whole eggs. We found that combining buttermilk with sour cream in this recipe created a great tangy flavor and gave the Cloudcakes an added lift. Adding cinnamon and sugar gave our Cloudcakes recipe a taste reminiscent of cinnamon toast.\n\n1. Whisk flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in large bowl. Stir buttermilk and sour cream together in medium bowl until combined. Add egg yolks and butter to buttermilk mixture, and stir well to combine. With electric mixer or balloon whisk, beat all 4 egg whites in large bowl to soft peaks. Pour buttermilk mixture over dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. (Batter should be lumpy, with visible streaks of flour.) Using spatula, carefully fold whites into batter until just combined. Do not overmix--a few streaks of whites should be visible.\n\n2. Heat 2 teaspoons oil in large nonstick skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Using 1/8-cup measure or small ladle, spoon batter into pan. Cook until bottoms are evenly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and cook until golden brown on second side, 2 to 3 minutes longer. Serve, cooking remaining batter and using more vegetable oil as needed to grease pan.",

Position vegetables cut sides down in single layer in center of sheet.\n\nPat chicken dry with paper towels. Leaving drumsticks and thighs attached, make 4 parallel diagonal slashes in chicken: 1 across drumsticks, 1 across leg joints, and 2 across thighs (each slash should reach bone). Season chicken with salt and pepper. Place 1 piece of chicken, skin side up, in each corner of sheet (chicken should rest directly on sheet, not on vegetables).\n\nWhisk garlic, lemon zest, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, and remaining 1 tablespoon sage together in bowl. Brush skin side of chicken with seasoned oil mixture (use all of it). Transfer sheet to lower-middle oven rack and bake until cauliflower is browned, shallots are tender, and chicken registers at least 175 degrees, 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nRemove sheet from oven and heat broiler. Scatter tomatoes over vegetables and place sheet on upper oven rack. Broil until chicken skin is browned and crisp and tomatoes have started to wilt, 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nTransfer sheet to wire rack and let rest for 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with lemon wedges.",
    "description": "Whole chicken legs (aka chicken leg quarters) are great to use for a cost-effective weeknight meal. For our goal of a one-pan meal, we decided to pair the chicken with cauliflower wedges and cherry tomatoes, all baked on one sheet pan. To help render the fat and season the chicken, we cut slashes through the meat and made a quick seasoned oil with olive oil, garlic, lemon, and sage to brush over the chicken. Positioning the cauliflower wedges in the center of the baking sheet, with the chicken on the perimeter, meant they would cook through in the same amount of time. To finish crisping the chicken skin and get some char on the cauliflower, we run the baking sheet under the broiler, along with the cherry tomatoes, for about 5 minutes.",

    "notes": "**made 2020-01-20** used bread flour; took about 4 hours to thaw from frozen.\n\nNew York-style pizza dough is an offshoot of Neapolitan-style dough—still a thin crust pie, but slightly thicker than its Italian cousin. The crust is sturdy, but not cracker-like, and instead features a tender chew thanks to the addition of oil in the dough. Using a food processor brings the dough together in 30 seconds flat, which is ready to bake the next day, so anyone can enjoy a city slice at home.\n\nWhy It Works\n    Oil coats individual granules of flour, creating a more tender finished product.\n    Sugar helps the crust to brown more evenly for a golden and flavorful crust.\n    The food processor develops the gluten faster than a stand mixer or by hand.\n    You can bake the dough the day after it's made, so no need for a long and slow ferment.\n\n",

    "directions": "1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees. Pat chops dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper.

Whisk in vinegar, parsley, and remaining apple butter. Season with salt and pepper. Serve, passing sauce at table.\n\nMake Ahead: Chops and sauce can be refrigerated separately for up to 2 days. To serve, heat sauce and chops together over medium heat until chops are warmed through.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Tasters preferred 1-inch blade chops in our recipe for Cider-Braised Pork Chops for their heft, silky meat, and rich taste. It took a little longer for the chops to become tender, but the wait was worth it. Patting the chops dry before adding them to the heated Dutch oven helped them develop a flavorful crust. Apple cider lent a sweet tartness to the braising mixture and sauce, while a bit of fresh thyme provided a heady herbal component. Jarred apple butter added tons of flavor, and its natural pectin gave the sauce a thick, glossy consistency.",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nWe like the tang that buttermilk adds, but you can use regular milk; substitute 1/2 cup whole milk combined with 11/2 teaspoons lemon juice or distilled white vinegar. Avoid potato granules, which have a slightly metallic taste. We find that 85 percent lean ground beef is the best option here. Fattier options (such as 80 percent lean ground beef) can be a bit greasy. Leaner options will make fairly dry meatballs. Cooking times for gluten-free pasta vary from brand to brand. Make sure to taste the pasta often, as it can overcook quickly. **Make sure to buy potato flakes, not potato granules**, which have a slightly metallic taste.",

    "directions": "In a large nonstick skillet over medium-high, heat oil until shimmering. Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring constantly to avoid browning, until tender and fragrant, about 3 minutes. Add ground beef and cook, using a wooden spoon to break up meat into small pieces, until the beef starts to brown, about 5 minutes.\n\nAdd chile powder, salt, ground cumin, black pepper, smoked paprika, dried oregano, ketchup, and 1 cup (240 ml) water. Cook, using a wooden spoon to scrape and stir bottom of the skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until liquid slightly thickens, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat, season to taste, and cover to keep warm; set aside.\n\nFor the Cheese Sauce: In a medium saucepan, toss grated cheddar with cornstarch to evenly coat. Add 1 1/4 cups (300 ml) evaporated milk, salt, black pepper, and smoked paprika. Cook on low heat, whisking constantly, until melted and smooth, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\n\nDivide cooked rice equally among 4 plates. Top each with taco meat, followed by the cheese sauce, lettuce, and sliced tomato. Garnish with salsa and crushed tortilla chips.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "For the cheese, if you want to keep it classic, you can skip making the cheese sauce and use 1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar instead. To serve, add 1/4 cup of cheddar on top of each serving of beef. The residual heat of the meat will slightly melt the cheese. To get the best melty texture, use freshly grated cheddar, preferably on the thicker grated side. Pregrated, store-bought cheddar has extra ingredients that prevent it from as easily melting compared to the freshly grated stuff.",

    "directions": "**For the Vinaigrette**: Whisk all ingredients in bowl until emulsified.\n\nFor the Salad: Cook pancetta in large Dutch oven over medium heat until browned and fat is rendered, 7 to 8 minutes. Using slotted spoon, transfer pancetta to paper towel–lined plate. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot. Add fennel and walnuts to fat left in pot and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fennel is crisp-tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pot from heat and let cool for 5 minutes.\n\nAdd half of vinaigrette to pot, then add half of greens and toss for 1 minute to warm and wilt. Add remaining greens followed by remaining vinaigrette and continue to toss until greens are evenly coated and warmed through, about 2 minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer greens to serving platter, top with apple, sprinkle with blue cheese and pancetta, and serve.\n\n",
    "description": "Why This Recipe Works\n\nUsing a preheated Dutch oven provided just the right amount of heat to wilt hearty bitter greens without actually cooking them. We started by sautéing vegetables in the pot and then pulled the pot off the heat to let it cool slightly. When we added the greens, the warm vegetables slightly softened the greens and helped the entire salad retain heat longer. Finally, carefully choosing mix-ins that delivered a wide range of flavors and textures made these salads truly satisfying entrées.",

    "name": "Classic Shepherd's Pie (with Beef And/Or Lamb)",
    "ingredients": "**For the Mashed Potatoes:**\n3 1/2 pounds (1.6kg) russet potatoes (about 4 large), peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces\nKosher salt\n6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, cubed\n\n**For the Meat Sauce:**\n1 1/2 cups (360ml) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock\n2 packets unflavored gelatin (about 5 teaspoons; 1/2 ounce; 14g)\n2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil\n2 1/2 pounds (1kg) ground beef or lamb, or some combination (see notes)\n1 large yellow onion (about 14 ounces; 400g), diced\n3 medium carrots (about 8 ounces; 225g), diced\n2 ribs celery (about 4 ounces; 110g), diced\n2 medium cloves garlic, minced\n2 tablespoons (30ml) tomato paste\n1 cup (240ml) dry red wine\n2 sprigs thyme\n1 bay leaf\n1 tablespoon (15ml) Worcestershire sauce\n1 teaspoon (5ml) Marmite (optional)\n2 tablespoons (15g) all-purpose flour\n8 ounces (225g) frozen peas\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n\n**To Assemble:**\n1 1/2 cups (360ml) heavy cream\nGrated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for topping (optional)",
    "directions": "**For the Mashed Potatoes:**\nSet cubed potatoes in a colander and rinse under cold water until water runs clear. Transfer to a large saucepan and cover with cold water by at least 2 inches. Season water with salt until almost as salty as the sea. Bring water to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until a knife easily pierces potatoes with no resistance, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain potatoes in colander, then rinse with hot running water for 30 seconds. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl.\n\nUsing a potato masher, food mill, or ricer, mash potatoes with butter. Press surface smooth, then press plastic wrap directly against surface to prevent a skin from forming. Set aside until ready to assemble.\n\n**Meanwhile, for the Meat Sauce:**\nPlace stock in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup, sprinkle with gelatin, and set aside.\n\nHeat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. Add half of ground meat and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot, until well browned, 6 to 8 minutes; use a potato masher or large whisk to break up meat. Add remaining meat and cook, breaking up with masher or whisk, until reduced to small bits, about 3 minutes; lower heat as necessary to prevent scorching. If meat has rendered an excessive amount of fat, use a metal spoon to ladle most of it out, leaving just a few tablespoons in the pot. Add onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and cook, stirring and scraping bottom of pot, until just beginning to soften slightly, about 4 minutes.\n\nAdd tomato paste and cook over medium heat, stirring, for 1 minute. Add red wine and bring to a simmer over high heat. Cook, scraping up any browned bits, until almost fully evaporated. Add reserved chicken stock, thyme, bay leaf, Worcestershire, and Marmite, if using. Sprinkle flour over ground meat in pot, then stir in. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce is reduced and thick, about 20 minutes. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf. Stir in peas and season with salt and pepper.\n\nTo Assemble and Bake: Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Before assembling, heat cream in a large saucepan until simmering. Add potatoes and stir gently until completely incorporated. Season with salt and pepper. Potatoes are now ready for assembly.\n\nSet a 9- by 13-inch baking dish on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Add meat sauce, being careful not to fill more than halfway. (You might not need all of the sauce, depending on the exact size of your baking dish.) Top with mashed potatoes, spreading them with a spatula to cover surface completely. Using spatula, create a dappled pattern on top of potatoes. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan cheese, if using.\n\nTransfer to oven and bake until top is browned and casserole is fully heated through, about 20 minutes. For deeper browning, place casserole on a rack set about 6 inches under a hot broiler for the last few moments of cooking. (Monitor closely to prevent potatoes from burning.)\n\nLet stand 15 to 20 minutes before serving. \n\n**Casserole can be assembled, wrapped with plastic, and refrigerated up to 2 days**. Reheat in a 350°F (180°C) oven for about 35 minutes, then use broiler to brown top.",

    "name": "Garlic-Lime Grilled Pork Tenderloin Steaks",
    "ingredients": "2 pounds pork tenderloins (2 loins), trimmed\n1 tablespoon grated lime zest, from 2 limes\n¼ cup lime juice, from 2 limes\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n4 teaspoons honey\n2 teaspoons fish sauce\n¾ teaspoon salt\n½ teaspoon pepper\n½ cup vegetable oil\n4 teaspoons mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro\nFlake sea salt (optional)",
    "directions": "Slice each tenderloin in half crosswise to create 4 steaks total. Pound each half to 3/4-inch thickness. Using sharp knife, cut 1/8-inch-deep slits spaced 1/2 inch apart in crosshatch pattern on both sides of steaks.\n\nWhisk lime zest and juice, garlic, honey, fish sauce, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle oil into lime mixture until smooth and slightly thickened. Transfer 1/2 cup lime mixture to small bowl and whisk in mayonnaise; set aside sauce. Add steaks to bowl with remaining marinade and toss thoroughly to coat; transfer steaks and marinade to large zipper-lock bag, press out as much air as possible, and seal bag. Let steaks sit at room temperature for 45 minutes.\n\nFOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over half of grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\nFOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).\n\nClean and oil cooking grate. Remove steaks from marinade (do not pat dry) and place over hotter part of grill. Cook, uncovered, until well browned on first side, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip steaks and cook until well browned on second side, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer steaks to cooler part of grill, with wider end of each steak facing hotter part of grill. Cover and cook until meat registers 140 degrees, 3 to 8 minutes longer (remove steaks as they come to temperature). Transfer steaks to carving board and let rest for 5 minutes.\n\nWhile steaks rest, microwave reserved sauce until warm, 15 to 30 seconds; stir in cilantro. Slice steaks against grain into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Drizzle with half of sauce; sprinkle with sea salt, if using; and serve, passing remaining sauce separately.",
    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\n\nThin pork medallions are tricky to cook well on the grill. We ditched the traditional shape in favor of pork tenderloin “steaks” by cutting tenderloins in half and pounding them to 3/4 inch thick. This simple step increased their surface area for a better ratio of browned exterior to tender interior. We also cut thin slashes in the steaks to promote better penetration of a garlic-citrus marinade that includes honey for better browning and fish sauce for meatiness. Finally we left excess marinade on the steaks to help keep their exteriors from drying out on the grill and then thickened some reserved marinade with mayonnaise for a bold finishing sauce.",

    "name": "Pommes De Terre Fondantes (Fondant Potatoes)",
    "ingredients": "1 1/2 cups homemade chicken or beef stock, or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth, plus extra as needed\n1/4 ounce (2 1/2 teaspoons; 1 packet; 7g) unflavored gelatin, such as Knox\n2 1/2 pounds (1.1kg) Yukon Gold potatoes, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches long each, peeled\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil, beef fat, schmaltz, or duck fat (see note)\n4 tablespoons (55g) unsalted butter\n3 medium garlic cloves (15g), peeled and smashed\n1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves, chopped\nFlaky sea salt, such as Maldon, for finishing (optional)",
    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Place stock in a liquid measuring cup or small bowl and sprinkle gelatin over top. Set aside.\n\nVicky Wasik\n\nUsing a sharp knife, cut off ends of potatoes to give them flat sides, then halve potatoes crosswise. Pat dry with paper towels.\n\nIn a 12-inch stainless steel straight-sided sauté pan or skillet, or cast iron skillet, heat oil or fat over medium-high heat until just beginning to smoke. Season potatoes with salt and pepper and add to skillet, broad side down, in a single layer with space between each piece. Cook, without moving, until potatoes begin to brown around edges, 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook, rotating and swirling pan gently to promote even browning and prevent sticking, until potatoes are deeply browned on bottom side, 3 to 4 minutes longer, adjusting heat as needed if some of the pieces brown too quickly.\n\nUsing a thin metal spatula, flip potatoes onto second flat side. Add butter and cook, swirling constantly, until butter is melted and begins to foam, about 1 minute. Add garlic and thyme, and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add stock and bring to a boil.\n\nTransfer skillet to oven and roast until potatoes are completely tender, offering little to no resistance when poked with a paring knife, and liquid is reduced to a saucy consistency, 25 to 30 minutes.\n\nReturn skillet to stovetop. Using a thin metal spatula or tongs, transfer potatoes to a serving platter, broad side up, leaving sauce in the skillet; discard garlic. Bring sauce to a simmer over medium heat and cook, swirling and stirring constantly, until sauce is emulsified, 30 seconds to 1 minute. If emulsion appears broken or sauce is too thick, add more stock or water, 1 tablespoon (15ml) at a time, until you reach the desired consistency. Season to taste with salt and pepper and pour sauce over and around potatoes. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt (if using, otherwise season with a little more kosher salt), and serve.\n\nVicky Wasik\n\nThis dish is best enjoyed immediately, but leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat with additional stock, up to 1/4 cup (60ml), to loosen and then re-emulsify the sauce.",

    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nTo create stovetop Brussels sprouts that were deeply browned on the cut sides while still bright green on the uncut sides and crisp-tender within, we started the sprouts in a cold skillet with plenty of oil and cooked them covered. This gently heated the sprouts and created a steamy environment that cooked them through without adding any extra moisture. We then removed the lid and continued to cook the sprouts cut sides down so they had time to develop a substantial, caramelized crust. Using enough oil to completely coat the skillet ensured that all the sprouts made full contact with the fat to brown evenly from edge to edge.",
    "notes": "**18-Jun-2019**: Try dropping temp to medium in step 1 because burned when on original med-high directions\n\nLook for Brussels sprouts that are similar in size, with small, tight heads that are no more than 1 1/2 inches in diameter, as they’re likely to be sweeter and more tender than larger sprouts. Parmesan cheese can be substituted for the Pecorino, if desired.",

    "name": "Thick-Cut Oven Fries",
    "ingredients": "3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes, unpeeled\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\nSalt",
    "directions": "Choose potatoes that are 4 to 6 inches in length to ensure well-proportioned fries. Trimming thin slices from the ends of the potatoes in step 2 ensures that each fry has two flat surfaces for even browning. This recipe's success is dependent on a heavy-duty rimmed baking sheet that will not warp in the heat of the oven. Spraying the sheet with vegetable oil spray will help the oil spread evenly and prevent sticking. The rate at which the potatoes brown is dependent on your baking sheet and oven. After removing the foil from the baking sheet in step 5, monitor the color of the potatoes carefully to prevent scorching.\n\nDESCRIPTION TEXT\n\n1. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and heat oven to 425 degrees. Generously spray rimmed baking sheet with vegetable oil spray. Pour oil into prepared sheet and tilt sheet until surface is evenly coated with oil.\n\n2. Halve potatoes lengthwise and turn halves cut sides down on cutting board. Trim thin slice from both long sides of each potato half; discard trimmings. Slice potatoes lengthwise into ⅓- to ½-inch-thick planks.\n\n3. Combine ¾ cup water and cornstarch in large bowl, making sure no lumps of cornstarch remain on bottom of bowl. Microwave, stirring every 20 seconds, until mixture begins to thicken, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from microwave and continue to stir until mixture thickens to pudding-like consistency. (If necessary, add up to 2 tablespoons water to achieve correct consistency.)\n\n4. Transfer potatoes to bowl with cornstarch mixture and toss until each plank is evenly coated. Arrange planks on prepared sheet, leaving small gaps between planks. (Some cornstarch mixture will remain in bowl.) Cover sheet tightly with lightly greased aluminum foil and bake for 12 minutes.\n\n5. Remove foil from sheet and bake until bottom of each fry is golden brown, 10 to 18 minutes. Remove sheet from oven and, using thin metal spatula, carefully flip each fry. Return sheet to oven and continue to bake until second sides are golden brown, 10 to 18 minutes longer. Sprinkle fries with ½ teaspoon salt. Using spatula, carefully toss fries to distribute salt. Transfer fries to paper towel–lined plate and season with salt to taste. Serve.",

    "name": "Roasted Artichoke Dip with Spinach",
    "ingredients": "Topping:\n2 slices high-quality white sandwich bread, quartered\n2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted\n\nDip:\n1 (9-ounce) box frozen artichokes (do not thaw)\n1 (10-ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry\n2 tablespoons olive oil\nSalt and ground black pepper\n1 medium onion, minced\n2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\n1 cup mayonnaise\n4 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature\n1 ounce Parmesan cheese, grated (about 1/2 cup)\n2 tablespoons juice from 1 lemon\n1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme leaves\nPinch cayenne pepper",
    "directions": "1. FOR THE TOPPING: Pulse the bread in a food processor to coarse crumbs, about 6 pulses. Toss the bread crumbs with the Parmesan and butter; set aside.\n\n2. FOR THE DIP: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil. Toss the artichokes with 1 tablespoon of the oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and spread out over the prepared baking sheet. Roast the artichokes, stirring occasionally, until browned at the edges, about 25 minutes. Let the artichokes cool and then chop coarse.\n\n3. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until just shimmering. Add the onion and cook until softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and chopped spinach and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Transfer the onion and spinach mixture to a large bowl and set aside.\n\n4. Stir the mayonnaise, cream cheese, Parmesan, lemon juice, thyme, and cayenne into the onion mixture until uniform, smearing any lumps of cream cheese against the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula. Gently fold in the chopped artichokes and season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer the mixture to an ungreased 8-inch square baking dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle the bread crumbs evenly over the top.\n\n5. TO STORE: Cover the baking dish tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for up to 3 days.\n\n6. TO SERVE: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Unwrap the dip and bake, uncovered, until hot throughout and the bread crumbs are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Right off the bat, we knew we’d need to find a replacement for the tinny-tasting canned artichokes that most roasted artichoke dip recipes use. We liked frozen artichokes, which were passable if boiled, but far better if roasted with a little olive oil, salt, and pepper. Most artichoke dip recipes specify a 1-1 ratio of mayo to cheese; however, we found this made for a dip with a grainy texture. More mayonnaise remedied that, but the resulting batch lacked the creaminess we wanted. Adding sour cream made the dip’s flavor too tart, but a small amount of cream cheese produced a dip every bit as creamy as we wanted.",

    "description": "",
    "notes": "Freshly squeezed lime juice is highly recommended. Many bottled juices include a sweetener and that will make the dulce de tequila too sweet. Since a lime typically yields 1 ounce of juice, you should be fine squeezing half a lime directly into the shaker.\n\nSuperfine sugar has finer granules than regular white sugar and is often preferred for rimming because of its more delicate texture. There's no need to hunt it down at the store, though. With the help of a food processor, you can quickly make superfine sugar at home.\n\nThis recipe originally suggested only a lemon wedge as the garnish. That's unusual since lime is used in the recipe. If you want to get the most out of a single fruit, cut a lime in half, using one piece for the juice and the other to create a wedge for the garnish.",

    "directions": "For the chicken: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. In a small bowl, stir together the olive oil, sumac, allspice, black pepper, and cumin. Arrange chicken, skin side up, on prepared baking sheet and season all over with salt. Rub all over with spiced oil, pushing some under the skin. Roast chicken until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 150°F (66°C) for the breast, about 25 minutes, or 175°F (80°C) for the legs, about 30 minutes. Let chicken rest 15 minutes, reserving any accumulated juices for the onions.\n\nMeanwhile, for the onions: In a medium Dutch oven or large skillet or sauté pan set over medium-low heat, stir together the olive oil, onions, and salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions have softened completely and are turning golden around some edges, about 30 minutes; adjust heat as needed to either speed up or slow down the rate of cooking so that it's gentle but active.\n\nStir in the sumac, cumin, cinnamon, black pepper, and chicken broth, along with any reserved chicken juices, and cook, stirring often, until onions have cooked down to a jammy and glazed consistency, about 10 minutes longer. Remove from the heat and set aside.\n\nTo serve: Turn on broiler and position top rack about 4 to 6 inches from broiler element. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. Working with one flatbread at a time, moisten the edges of each flatbread by dipping it into the oily glaze on the surface of the onion mixture and rotating it around. Set the flatbread on the prepared baking sheet.\n\nSpoon about a quarter of the onion mixture onto the flatbread and spread it around in an even layer, leaving a thin border around the edge (similar to pizza). Sprinkle all over with sumac and toasted pine nuts. Repeat with remaining flatbreads, onions, sumac, and pine nuts, stacking them one on top of the other (this keeps them moist, especially as you start to broil them).\n\nIf chicken has cooled too much, insert it under the broiler just long enough to rewarm and re-crisp the skin. Working with one or two flat breads at a time, arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and broil until the flatbread's edges have browned in spots, 1 to 4 minutes (keep a close eye on them as broiler strength can vary quite a bit). Transfer each flatbread to a plate, top with a whole piece of chicken, and serve.\n\nThe prepared onion mixture can be refrigerated for up to 3 days in an airtight container, then reheated just before assembly.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Taboon bread is best for this dish, but a sturdy flatbread, like homemade or store-bought pocketless pita or naan will do in a pinch.\n\nTo toast pine nuts: Toss nuts with 1 tablespoon olive oil, place on a microwave-safe plate, and microwave at 1 minute intervals, stirring in between, until golden brown and toasty, about 3 minutes total; alternatively, toast by tossing the nuts with 1 tablespoon olive oil and cooking over medium-low heat in a skillet, stirring constantly, until toasted, about 5 minutes total.",

    "ingredients": "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n2 tablespoons minced fresh chives\n1 garlic clove, minced to paste\nSalt and pepper\n2 (1-pound) pork tenderloins, trimmed\n¼ cup hoisin sauce\n1 pound green beans, trimmed\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 ½ pounds fingerling potatoes, unpeeled, halved lengthwise\n\nSee:\n[recipe:Gluten Free Hoisin Sauce]",
    "directions": "1. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. Combine butter, chives, garlic, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in bowl; set aside. Pat pork dry with paper towels and season with pepper. Brush tenderloins all over with hoisin sauce.\n\n2. Toss green beans, 1 tablespoon oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in large bowl. Arrange green bean mixture crosswise down center of rimmed baking sheet, leaving room on both sides for potatoes. Toss potatoes, remaining 2 tablespoons oil, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in now-empty bowl. Arrange potatoes, cut side down, on both sides of green beans.\n\n3. Lay tenderloins, side by side without touching, lengthwise on top of green beans. Roast until pork registers 140 degrees, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer tenderloins to carving board and dot each with 1 tablespoon reserved herb butter. Tent with aluminum foil and let rest while vegetables finish cooking.\n\n4. Gently stir vegetables on sheet to combine. Return sheet to oven and roast until vegetables are tender and golden brown, 5 to 10 minutes longer. Remove from oven, add remaining 2 tablespoons herb butter to sheet, and toss vegetables to coat. Transfer vegetables to platter. Cut pork into 1/2-inch-thick slices and place over vegetables, pouring any accumulated juices over top. Serve.\n\nOne-Pan Pork Tenderloin with Green Beans and Potatoes\n\nPlacing the tenderloins directly over the green beans creates steam, which helps the beans cook through without drying out. The drippings from the meat also help flavor the green beans.",

    "notes": "Buy tenderloins that are of equal size and weight so they cook at the same rate. A rasp-style grater makes quick work of turning the garlic into a paste. Our favorite hoisin sauce is Kikkoman’s.",

    "ingredients": "5-6 pounds boneless pork butt, not trimmed, cut into 2-inch cubes\n1 large yellow onion, halved and thinly sliced\n10 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled\n2 tablespoons ground cumin\n2 tablespoons ground coriander\n2 teaspoons dried oregano\n½ teaspoon dried thyme\n1 teaspoon red pepper flakes\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n1 cup vegetable oil\n\n**Additions from Serious Eats carnitas**\n1 whole orange, quartered\n2 bay leaves\n",
    "directions": "Heat the oven to 325°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. In a large (at least 7-quart) Dutch oven, stir together the pork, onion, garlic, cumin, coriander, oregano, thyme, pepper flakes, orange quarters (squeezing juice in), bay leaves, and 2 teaspoons salt. Stir in the oil and 1 cup water. Cover, transfer to the oven and cook for 3 hours.\n\nRemove the pot from the oven. Stir the pork and return the pot, uncovered, to the oven. Cook until a skewer inserted into the meat meets no resistance, another 30 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the meat to a rimmed baking sheet in an even layer to cool. Tilt the pot to pool the cooking liquid to one side, then use a wide spoon to skim off as much fat as possible; reserve the fat. Bring the defatted cooking liquid to a simmer over medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until reduced to about ⅓ cup, about 5 minutes. Set aside.\n\nWhen the meat is cool enough to handle, break the chunks into ¾- to 1-inch pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat. Add the pork back to the pot and stir until evenly moistened with the reduced cooking liquid.\n\nIn a nonstick 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 teaspoon of the reserved fat until barely smoking. Add the pork in an even layer and cook without stirring, pressing the meat against the skillet with a spatula, until the bottom begins to brown and the pork is heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Tip: Don't trim the fat from the pork shoulder. The pork should render its fat in the oven and so the meat cooks slowly in it and the juices. And after cooking, don't discard the fat you skim off the cooking liquid—you'll need some of it to crisp the shredded pork in a hot skillet.\n\n\nMade 2024-12 - Excellent results. Maybe slightly overcooked, might try reducing first cook time by 15-20 minutes.\nTried on 13-May-2020. Results?",

    "directions": "FOR THE DOUGH: Adjust oven rack 4 to 5 inches from broiler element, set pizza stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees.\n\nWhile oven heats, process bread flour, semolina flour, yeast, and sugar in food processor until combined, about 2 seconds. With processor running, slowly pour warm water, lager, vinegar, and oil through feed tube; process until dough is just combined and no dry flour remains, about 10 seconds. Let dough stand for 10 minutes.\n\nAdd salt to dough and process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of workbowl, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and gently knead until smooth, about 15 seconds. Divide dough into 2 equal pieces and shape each into smooth ball.\n\nSpray 11-inch circle in center of large sheet of parchment paper with oil spray. Place 1 ball of dough in center of parchment. Spray top of dough with oil spray. Using rolling pin, roll dough into 10-inch circle. Cover with second sheet of parchment. Using rolling pin and your hands, continue to roll and press dough into 11½-inch circle. Set aside and repeat rolling with second ball of dough. Let dough stand at room temperature until slightly puffy, 30 minutes.\n\nFOR THE SAUCE: Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to medium bowl.\n\nFOR THE PIZZA: When dough has rested for 20 minutes, heat broiler for 10 minutes. Remove top piece of parchment from 1 disk of dough and dust top of dough lightly with all-purpose flour. Using your hands or pastry brush, spread flour evenly over dough, brushing off any excess. Liberally dust pizza peel with all-purpose flour. Flip dough onto peel, parchment side up. Carefully remove parchment and discard.\n\nUsing back of spoon or ladle, spread ½ cup sauce in thin layer over surface of dough, leaving ¾-inch border around edge. Sprinkle ¼ cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by ¾ cup mozzarella. Slide pizza carefully onto stone and return oven to 500 degrees. Bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 8 to 12 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through baking.\n\nTransfer pizza to wire rack and let cool for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat steps 6 and 7 to top and bake second pizza.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "For the best results, weigh your ingredients. We like the depth anchovies add to the sauce, but you can omit them, if desired. For the mild lager, we recommend Budweiser or Stella Artois. Extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to a month. Some baking stones can crack under the intense heat of the broiler. Our recommended stone from Old Stone Oven won't, but if you're using another stone, check the manufacturer's website. If you don't have a pizza peel, use an overturned rimmed baking sheet instead.",

    "name": "Thin-Crust Pizza",
    "ingredients": "**Dough**\n3 cups (16 1/2 ounces) bread flour, plus more for work surface (see note)\n2 tablespoons sugar\n½ teaspoon instant or rapid-rise yeast\n1 ⅓ cups (10 1/2 ounces) ice water \n1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more for work surface\n1 ½ teaspoons table salt\n\n**Sauce**\n1 (28-ounce) can whole peeled tomatoes, drained and liquid discarded\n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon red wine vinegar\n2 medium garlic cloves (about 2 teaspoons) minced\n1 teaspoon table salt\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n¼ teaspoon ground black pepper\n\n**Cheese**\n1 ounce finely grated Parmesan cheese (about 1/2 cup) 8 ounces whole milk mozzarella, shredded (about 2 cups) (see note)",
    "directions": "FOR THE DOUGH: In food processor fitted with metal blade, process flour, sugar, and yeast until combined, about 2 seconds. With machine running, slowly add water through feed tube; process until dough is just combined and no dry flour remains, about 10 seconds. Let dough stand 10 minutes.\n\nAdd oil and salt to dough and process until dough forms satiny, sticky ball that clears sides of workbowl, 30 to 60 seconds. Remove dough from bowl and knead briefly on lightly oiled countertop until smooth, about 1 minute. Shape dough into tight ball and place in large, lightly oiled bowl. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours and up to 3 days.\n\nFOR THE SAUCE: Process all ingredients in food processor until smooth, about 30 seconds. Transfer to medium bowl or container and refrigerate until ready to use.\n\nTO BAKE THE PIZZA: One hour before baking pizza, adjust oven rack to second highest position (rack should be about 4 to 5 inches below broiler), set pizza stone on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Remove dough from refrigerator and divide in half. Shape each half into smooth, tight ball. Place on lightly oiled baking sheet, spacing them at least 3 inches apart; cover loosely with plastic wrap coated with nonstick cooking spray; let stand for 1 hour.\n\nCoat 1 ball of dough generously with flour and place on well-floured countertop. Using fingertips, gently flatten into 8-inch disk, leaving 1 inch of outer edge slightly thicker than center. Using hands, gently stretch disk into 12-inch round, working along edges and giving disk quarter turns as you stretch. Transfer dough to well-floured peel and stretch into 13-inch round. Using back of spoon or ladle, spread 1/2 cup tomato sauce in thin layer over surface of dough, leaving 1/4-inch border around edge. Sprinkle 1/4 cup Parmesan evenly over sauce, followed by 1 cup mozzarella. Slide pizza carefully onto stone and bake until crust is well browned and cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown, 10 to 12 minutes, rotating pizza halfway through. Remove pizza and place on wire rack for 5 minutes before slicing and serving. Repeat step 5 to shape, top, and bake second pizza.\n\nTOPPING TIPS: We like our Thin-Crust Pizza simply dressed with tomato sauce and handfuls of shredded mozzarella and Parmesan, but additional toppings are always an option--provided they're prepared correctly and added judiciously. (An overloaded pie will bake up soggy.) Here are a few guidelines for how to handle different types of toppings.\n\nHEARTY VEGETABLES Aim for a maximum of 6 ounces per pie, spread out in a single layer. Vegetables such as onions, peppers, and mushrooms should be thinly sliced and lightly sautéed (or microwaved for a minute or two along with a little olive oil) before using.\n\nDELICATE VEGETABLES AND HERBS Leafy greens and herbs like spinach and basil are best placed beneath the cheese to protect them or added raw to the fully cooked pizza.\n\nMEATS Proteins (no more than 4 ounces per pie) should be precooked and drained to remove excess fat. We like to poach meats like sausage (broken up into 1/2-inch chunks), pepperoni, or ground beef for 4 to 5 minutes in a wide skillet along with 1/4 cup of water, which helps to render the fat while keeping the meat moist.",
    "description": "",
    "notes": "Our preferred brand of whole-milk mozzarella is Sorrento Galbani. You can shape the second dough ball while the first pizza bakes, but don't top the pizza until right before you bake it. If you don't have a baking stone, bake the pizzas on an overturned and preheated rimmed baking sheet. It is important to use ice water in the dough to prevent overheating the dough while in the food processor. Semolina flour is ideal for dusting the peel; use it in place of bread flour if you have it. The sauce will yield more than needed in the recipe; extra sauce can be refrigerated for up to a week or frozen for up to a month.",

    "name": "Argentinian-Style Stuffed Pork Loin with Chimichurri",
    "ingredients": "3 cups lightly packed fresh flat-leaf parsley\nLeaves from 1 bunch fresh oregano (⅓ to ½ cup)\n7 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled\n1½ teaspoons ground cumin\n1½ teaspoons ground coriander\n¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n¼ cup red wine vinegar\n¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon ground cumin\n1 tablespoon ground coriander\n2 teaspoons packed light brown sugar\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n4 pound boneless center-cut pork loin\n6 ounces thinly sliced capicola or mortadella\n½ cup pitted green olives, roughly chopped\n1½ cups drained roasted red peppers, patted dry and torn into large pieces\n⅓ cup panko breadcrumbs\n3 hard-cooked large eggs, peeled and halved crosswise\n1½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\nFlaky sea salt, to serve (optional)",
    "directions": "To prepare the chimichurri, in a food processor, combine the parsley, oregano, garlic, cumin, coriander, pepper flakes, ½ teaspoon each salt and black pepper. Process until finely chopped, 30 to 45 seconds. Scrape the bowl, add the vinegar and oil, then process until as smooth as possible, 45 to 60 seconds. Measure ¼ cup of the chimichurri into a small bowl and set aside; transfer the remainder to a serving bowl; cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.\n\nHeat the oven to 350°F with a rack in the lower-middle position. Line a rimmed baking sheet with extra-wide foil and a fit with a wire rack. To prepare the roast, in a small bowl, stir together the cumin, coriander, brown sugar, 1½ teaspoons each salt and pepper. Set aside.\n\nCut eight 24-inch lengths of kitchen twine. Place the roast fat side down on a cutting board, perpendicular to the counter's edge. With a sharp boning or carving knife, cut along the length of the roast, down its center, stopping about ½ inch from the bottom. Starting at the base of the cut and with the knife blade held as parallel as possible to the cutting board, slice along the length of the roast, unrolling the meat with your free hand as you go. Continue cutting and unrolling the meat until the half is a flat, fairly even surface ½ to ¾ inch thick. Rotate the roast 180° and repeat with the second side. If there are areas that are slightly too thick, use a meat mallet to pound those areas to the same thickness.\n\nSeason the pork on both sides with the spice mixture. Place the meat fat side down and with a short side nearest you. Spread the reserved ¼ cup chimichurri evenly on the meat. Shingle on the capicola slices, covering the entire surface, then sprinkle evenly with the olives. Lay the red peppers on top, tearing as needed to cover the entire surface. Sprinkle evenly with the panko. Place the egg halves cut sides down in a row about 3inches from the bottom edge. Lift the bottom edge over the eggs and continue rolling the meat into a tight cylinder. Position the cylinder seam side down and tie at even intervals with the twine, then snip off excess twine. If any bits of filling fall out, simply tuck them back in. Brush the roast on all sides with the oil.\n\nTransfer roast fat side up to the prepared baking sheet. Bake until the top is nicely browned and center of the roast reaches 135°F, 1½ to 2 hours. Let rest on the wire rack for 30 to 60 minutes. Remove the chimichurri from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before serving. Cut the roast into ½-inch-thick slices, removing the twine as you go. Arrange the slices on a platter, sprinkle with flaky salt (if using) and serve with chimichurri.",

    "name": "Julia Child’s Stuffed and Split Turkey",
    "ingredients": "1 (12- to 15-pound) turkey, neck and giblets removed and reserved for gravy\n1 ½ teaspoon fresh sage minced\n1 teaspoon salt\n½ teaspoon pepper\n1 lb. sliced salt pork, rinsed well\nSalt and pepper\nWooden skewers\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n\n",
    "directions": "1. With turkey breast side up, using boning or paring knife, cut through skin around leg quarter where it attaches to breast. Bend leg back to pop leg bone out of socket. Cut through joint to separate leg quarter. Repeat to remove second leg quarter. Working with 1 leg quarter at a time and with skin side down, use tip of knife to cut along sides of thighbone to expose bone, then slide knife under bone to free meat. Without severing skin, cut joint between thigh and leg and remove thighbone. Reserve thighbones for gravy.\n\n2. Rub interior of each thigh with ¾ teaspoon sage, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper. Truss each thigh closed using wooden skewers and kitchen twine. Place leg quarters on large plate, cover, and **refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours**.\n\n3. Using kitchen shears, cut through ribs following vertical line of fat where breast meets back, from tapered end of breast to wing joint. Using your hands, bend back away from breast to pop shoulder joint out of socket. Cut through joint between bones to separate back from breast. Reserve back for gravy. Trim excess fat from breast. Dissolve ¾ cup salt in 6 quarts cold water in large container. Submerge breast in brine, cover, and **refrigerate for 6 to 12 hours**.\n\n4. Preheat oven temperature to **425 degrees**. Remove breast from brine and pat dry with paper towels (leave leg quarters in refrigerator). Tuck wings behind back. Brush surface with 2 teaspoons oil. Place turkey breast skin side down in skillet and roast in oven for** 30 minutes.**\n\n5. Remove breast from oven and, using 2 wads of paper towels, flip breast and place over two-thirds of stuffing. Arrange leg quarters over remaining stuffing and brush with remaining 1 teaspoon oil. Lightly season breast and leg quarters with salt. Tuck any large sections of exposed stuffing under bird so most of stuffing is covered by turkey. Transfer pan to oven and cook for **30 minutes** .\n\n6. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees. Continue to roast until thickest part of breast registers 160 to 165 degrees and thickest part of thigh registers 175 to 180 degrees, 40 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes longer. Transfer breast and leg quarters to cutting board and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\n7. Before serving, remove skewers and twine from leg quarters and place on each side of breast. Carve and serve.",

    "notes": "2024-11 - Try brine of 3.75% salinity - 3.5 for 12 hours was too little - **Check temp after first 45 minutes**\n2014-11 - Try barding the turkey without stuffing beneath. Cook stuffing in separate pan and baste with the turkey juices throughout.\n\nWHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: In her 1989 cookbook, The Way to Cook, Julia Child separated a raw turkey into legs and breast to ensure that both white and dark meat were roasted to perfection. Other benefits included a quicker cooking time and a small mound of rich sausage stuffing that tasted as though it had been roasted inside the bird. We loved this idea but saw a couple of opportunities for improvement. In our version, we brined the breast to keep it juicy and flavorful. Jump-starting the cooking of the breast at 425 degrees decreased the overall cooking time, which also helped the meat retain moisture. To make even more stuffing, we increased the amount of bread, and we swapped the sausage for the brighter flavor of dried cranberries.",

    "name": "Grilled Vegetable Salad",
    "ingredients": "**Vinaigrette**\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n1 garlic clove, minced\n¼ teaspoon salt\n⅛ teaspoon pepper\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, mint, chives, or parsley\n\n**Vegetables**\n2 red bell peppers\n1 eggplant, halved lengthwise\n1 zucchini (8 to 10 ounces), halved lengthwise\n1 red onion, cut into 1/2-inch-thick rounds\n4 plum tomatoes, cored and halved lengthwise\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\nSalt and pepper",
    "directions": "BEFORE YOU BEGIN\n\nServe as a side dish to grilled meats and fish; with grilled pita as a salad course; or with hard-cooked eggs, olives, and premium canned tuna as a light lunch.\n\nFOR THE VINAIGRETTE: Whisk lemon juice, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in oil. Stir in basil and set aside.\n\nFOR THE VEGETABLES: Slice 1/4 inch off tops and bottoms of bell peppers and remove cores. Make slit down 1 side of each bell pepper, then press flat into 1 long strip, removing ribs and remaining seeds with knife as needed. Cut strips in half crosswise (you should have 4 bell pepper pieces).\n\nUsing sharp paring knife, cut ½-inch crosshatch pattern in flesh of eggplant and zucchini, being careful to cut down to but not through skin. Push toothpick horizontally through each onion round to keep rings intact while grilling. Brush tomatoes, bell peppers, zucchini, and onion all over with oil, then brush eggplant with remaining oil (it will absorb more oil than other vegetables). Season vegetables with salt and pepper.\n\nFOR A CHARCOAL GRILL: Open bottom vent completely. Light large chimney starter filled with charcoal briquettes (6 quarts). When top coals are partially covered with ash, pour evenly over grill. Set cooking grate in place, cover, and open lid vent completely. Heat grill until hot, about 5 minutes.\n\nFOR A GAS GRILL: Turn all burners to high, cover, and heat grill until hot, about 15 minutes. Turn all burners to medium-high.\n\nClean and oil cooking grate. Place vegetables on cooking grate, cut sides down, and cook until skins of bell peppers, eggplant, and tomatoes are well browned and interiors of eggplant and zucchini are tender, 10 to 16 minutes, flipping and moving vegetables as necessary to ensure even cooking and transferring vegetables to baking sheet as they finish cooking. Place bell peppers in bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let steam to loosen skins, about 5 minutes.\n\nWhen cool enough to handle, peel bell peppers and tomatoes, discarding skins. Using spoon, scoop eggplant flesh out of skin; discard skin. Chop all vegetables into 1-inch pieces, transfer to bowl with vinaigrette, and toss to coat. Serve warm or at room temperature.",

    "notes": "**Ten Simple Steps**\n[photo:1]\n1. MAKE VINAIGRETTE: Whisk lemon juice, mustard, garlic, salt, and pepper together in large bowl. Slowly whisk in oil, then stir in basil.\nWHY? Adding mustard to the mixture and slowly whisking in the oil emulsifies the vinaigrette so that it won’t break.\n\n[photo:2]\n2. PREP BELL PEPPERS: Slice off tops and bottoms of bell peppers and remove cores. Make slit down 1 side of each bell pepper, then press flat into 1 strip, removing ribs and remaining seeds as needed. Halve strips crosswise.\nWHY? Long, flat strips are easy to handle on the grill.\n\n[photo:3]\n3. SCORE EGGPLANT AND ZUCCHINI: Using sharp paring knife, cut 1/2 inch crosshatch pattern in flesh of eggplant and zucchini, being careful not to cut through skin.\n\nWHY? Cutting through the flesh of these watery vegetables helps them release excess moisture during grilling.\n\n[photo:4]\n4. KEEP ONIONS INTACT: Push toothpick horizontally through each onion round.\n\nWHY? The toothpicks keep the onion rounds intact, making them easier to flip.\n\n[photo:5]\n5. OIL AND SEASON VEGETABLES: Brush vegetables with oil. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nWHY? A generous coating of oil ensures that the vegetables won’t stick to the cooking grate. Seasoning the vegetables well ensures a flavorful salad.\n\n6. PREPARE GRILL: Pour single layer of hot coals into charcoal grill or turn all burners of gas grill to high.\n\nWHY? A hot grill imparts flavorful char to vegetables quickly and ensures that they won’t stick to the cooking grate.\n\n[photo:6]\n7. GRILL CUT SIDE DOWN: Arrange vegetables on cooking grate with their cut sides facing down and cook, turning occasionally, until well browned and tender.\n\nWHY? Grilling cut side down browns the flesh first. Finish on the skin side, which can withstand longer exposure to heat.\n\n[photo:8]\n8. PEEL AWAY SKINS: When tomatoes and bell peppers are cool, remove charred skins.\n\nWHY? Blistering the skins makes removing them easier. Simply slip the grilled tomato skins off with your fingers. Use our steam method (see “Prepping Vegetables and Herbs” ) for the bell peppers.\n\n[photo:7]\n9. SCOOP EGGPLANT: Using spoon, scoop eggplant flesh out of skin.\n\nWHY? The eggplant flesh becomes tender during grilling, but the skin toughens. Discard the charred skin and use only the soft eggplant flesh.\n\n35313_stp-grilledvegetablesalad-cutandtoss-08\n10. CUT AND TOSS: Chop all vegetables into 1-inch pieces, transfer to bowl with vinaigrette, and toss to coat.\n\nWHY? Dressing the vegetables soon after they come off the grill causes them to absorb more vinaigrette.",

Using slotted spoon, remove wings from slow cooker and transfer to clean large bowl (discard liquid in slow cooker). Let wings cool 20 minutes (or cool briefly and refrigerate up to 24 hours).\n\n3. SAUCE AND BROIL Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat broiler. Set wire rack inside rimmed baking sheet and spray rack with baking spray. Whisk water, tomato paste, remaining sugar, remaining soy sauce, and remaining cayenne in bowl. Add half of sauce to bowl with cooled wings and toss gently to coat. Arrange wings, skin side up, on prepared rack. Broil until wings are lightly charred and crisp around edges, 10 to 15 minutes. Flip wings, brush with remaining sauce, and continue to broil until well caramelized, about 3 minutes. Serve.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: When we tried adding the sauce for our Slow-Cooker Sticky Wings to the slow cooker, the juices from the wings drowned it out. Instead, we cooked the wings bare. A sauce of soy sauce, tomato paste, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and cayenne won out over more complex options. For through-and-through flavor, we borrowed an idea from barbecue pit masters and coated the wings with a spicy paste before cooking. Achieving an acceptable level of stickiness wasn’t possible with a slow cooker alone. To give the wings their requisite “stick,\" we painted the cooked wings with sauce and set them under the broiler.",

    "directions": "Arrange the tacos so they face the same direction in the skillet to make them easy to fit and flip. To ensure crispy tacos, cook the tortillas until they are deeply browned. To garnish, open each taco like a book and load it with your preferred toppings; close it to eat.\n\nAdjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Combine water and baking soda in large bowl. Add beef and mix until thoroughly combined. Set aside.\n\nHeat 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 6 minutes. Add chili powder, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in tomato paste and cook until paste is rust-colored, 1 to 2 minutes. Add beef mixture and cook, using wooden spoon to break meat into pieces no larger than ¼ inch, until beef is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer beef mixture to bowl; stir in cheddar until cheese has melted and mixture is homogeneous. Wipe skillet clean with paper towels.\n\nThoroughly brush both sides of tortillas with 2 tablespoons oil. Arrange tortillas, overlapping, on rimmed baking sheet in 2 rows (6 tortillas each). Bake until tortillas are warm and pliable, about 5 minutes. Remove tortillas from oven and reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees.\n\nPlace 2 tablespoons filling on 1 side of 1 tortilla. Fold and press to close tortilla (edges will be open, but tortilla will remain folded). Repeat with remaining tortillas and remaining filling. (At this point, filled tortillas can be covered and refrigerated for up to 12 hours.)\n\nSet wire rack in second rimmed baking sheet and line rack with double layer of paper towels. Heat remaining ¼ cup oil in now-empty skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Arrange 6 tacos in skillet with open sides facing away from you. Cook, adjusting heat so oil actively sizzles and bubbles appear around edges of tacos, until tacos are crispy and deeply browned on 1 side, 2 to 3 minutes. Using tongs and thin spatula, carefully flip tacos. Cook until deeply browned on second side, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting heat as necessary.\n\nRemove skillet from heat and transfer tacos to prepared wire rack. Blot tops of tacos with double layer of paper towels. Place sheet with fried tacos in oven to keep warm. Return skillet to medium-high heat and cook remaining tacos. Serve tacos immediately, passing extra cheddar, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, jalapeños, and hot sauce separately.",

    "directions": "FOR THE DIPPING SAUCE: Whisk all ingredients together in small bowl; set aside.\n\nFOR THE PANCAKES: Using wooden spoon, mix 1 1/2 cups flour and boiling water in bowl to form rough dough. When cool enough to handle, transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead until tacky (but not sticky) ball forms, about 4 minutes (dough will not be perfectly smooth). Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.\n\nWhile dough is resting, stir together 1 tablespoon vegetable oil, sesame oil, and remaining 1 tablespoon flour. Set aside.\n\nPlace 10-inch cast-iron skillet over low heat to preheat. Divide dough in half. Cover 1 half of dough with plastic wrap and set aside. Roll remaining dough into 12-inch round on lightly floured counter. Drizzle with 1 tablespoon oil-flour mixture and use pastry brush to spread evenly over entire surface. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and half of scallions. Roll dough into cylinder. Coil cylinder into spiral, tuck end underneath, and flatten spiral with your palm. Cover with plastic and repeat with remaining dough, oil-flour mixture, salt, and scallions.\n\nRoll first spiral into 9-inch round. Cut 1/2-inch slit in center of pancake. Cover with plastic. Roll and cut slit in second pancake. Place 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in skillet and increase heat to medium-low. Place 1 pancake in skillet (oil should sizzle). Cover and cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until pancake is slightly puffy and golden brown on underside, 1 to 1 1/2 minutes. (If underside is not browned after 1 minute, turn heat up slightly. If it is browning too quickly, turn heat down slightly.) Drizzle 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over pancake. Use pastry brush to distribute over entire surface. Carefully flip pancake. Cover and cook, shaking skillet occasionally, until second side is golden brown, 1 to 1½ minutes. Uncover skillet and continue to cook until bottom is deep golden brown and crispy, 30 to 60 seconds longer. Flip and cook until deep golden brown and crispy, 30 to 60 seconds. Transfer to wire rack. Repeat with remaining 3 tablespoons vegetable oil and remaining pancake. Cut each pancake into 8 wedges and serve, passing dipping sauce separately.\n\nTO MAKE AHEAD: Stack uncooked pancakes between layers of parchment paper, wrap tightly in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours or freeze for up to 1 month. If frozen, thaw pancakes in single layer for 15 minutes before cooking.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS:\nFor a vegetarian bean chili recipe that was rich and highly flavorful, with a nice, sharp heat as well as some gentle sweetness, we narrowed down a list of eight initial contenders to three beans with an earthy flavor and firm texture—red kidney, pinto, and black. To season our vegetarian bean chili recipe we decided to add a sweet red pepper to our base of onions and garlic. Chili powder, along with whole cumin seeds and a little cayenne, provided the depth and heat we sought. For the liquid, we decided to stick with water and the customary tomatoes.",

    "name": "Keto Quesadillas",
    "ingredients": "**Low-carb tortillas**\n2 eggs\n2 egg whites\n6 oz. cream cheese\n1½ teaspoons ground psyllium husk powder\n1 tablespoon coconut flour\n½ teaspoon salt\n\n**Filling**\n5 oz. shredded cheese\n1 oz. leafy greens\n1 tablespoon olive oil, for frying",
    "directions": "**Tortillas**\nPreheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).\n\nBeat the eggs and egg whites together until fluffy. (2-3 minutes with a mixer should do the trick.) Add the cream cheese and continue to beat until the batter is smooth.\n\nCombine the salt, psyllium husk powder, and coconut flour in a small bowl and mix well. Add this flour mixture one spoonful at a time into the batter while beating. When combined, let the batter sit for a few minutes. It should be thick like pancake batter. Your brand of psyllium husk powder affects this step — be patient… If it does not thicken enough, add more powder next time.\n\nPlace parchment paper on two baking sheets. Pour three circles on each sheet, for a total of six tortillas. Use a spatula to spread the batter into thin, ¼ inch thick rounds. Each tortilla should be about 5″ across.\n\nBake on the upper rack for about 5 minutes. The tortillas turn a little brown around the edges when done. Keep your eye on the oven—don’t let these tasty creations burn on the bottom!\n\n**Quesadillas**\nPlace three tortillas on a large cutting board. Spoon half the grated cheese on the tortillas.\n\nAdd a handful of leafy greens, sprinkle with remaining cheese, and top with another tortilla.\n\nHeat a small, non-stick skillet. Add oil (or butter) if desired. Fry each quesadilla for about a minute on each side. You’ll know it’s done when the cheese melts.\n\nCut quesadillas into wedges and serve.",

Cover and cook until paring knife meets no resistance when slipped into center of potatoes, about 12 minutes.\n\nDrain potatoes and return to saucepan.

We prefer a mixture of butterball potatoes and white sweet potatoes—it’s a nice combo of savory and a touch sweet. Then, we add bacon, eggs, and cheese, but it’s all optional. Feel free to build your breakfast sheet pan however you like. If you want to add in some peppers or mushrooms, we say go for it.\n\nPreheat your oven to 400°F. Add sliced potatoes with a drizzle of olive oil to your sheet pan and top it with a Seasoned Salt of your choice—Savory and Spicy work especially well. Roast potatoes 15–18 minutes until they are starting to brown on the bottom.\n\nRemove from the oven and flip potatoes. If you are adding bacon, now is the time. Add a few slices of bacon to cover the top of the potatoes, return to the oven and continue to roast until the bacon is mostly cooked, about 15 minutes.\n\nRemove from the oven again and make little wells in your potato stack. Crack the eggs into the wells and return the pan to the oven for 3 minutes.\n\nRemove from the oven and sprinkle with cheese and return for 1 minute, just until the cheese melts.

Set aside a large plate to transfer chicken to after breading.\n\nWorking with one chicken breast at a time, place chicken breast on a cutting board. Hold it in place with the palm of your non-cutting hand, and use a sharp knife to slice chicken horizontally into two even cutlets. Repeat process with remaining chicken breast. Cover each breast half with plastic wrap, and use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound to 1/3-inch thickness.\n\nPlace 2 chicken halves in prepared flour mixture, and turn to coat; tap off excess flour mixture, and transfer chicken to the large plate. Repeat process with remaining chicken halves.\n\nIn a large stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet, heat oil over medium-high until shimmering. Working in batches, add two chicken pieces to hot oil; cook, undisturbed, until golden brown on both sides, 4 to 5 minutes total. Repeat process with remaining 2 chicken pieces. Place browned chicken halves on prepared baking sheet, and place in warm oven (do not wipe out skillet).\n\nWhile chicken is resting in oven, heat the same skillet over medium-high. Add wine; cook, stirring occasionally and scraping up browned bits from bottom of skillet, until reduced to about 1/4 cup, 3 to 4 minutes. Add stock and cook, stirring constantly, until mixture has reduced to about 1/3 cup, 3 to 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low.

    "description": "Balsamic fig pan sauce is like an Italian-style sweet and sour with a big hit of umami. Finely chopped dried figs are cooked with balsamic until the fruit is softened and the vinegar turns syrupy. It’s mounted with butter for silky richness, then spooned over Italian herb-seasoned pork chops. To complement the pork, there’s herbed ricotta mixed with crushed red pepper flakes for dipping, plus tender roasted broccoli and cabbage blanketed in melted Parmesan cheese. As a finishing touch, everything is sprinkled with toasted pine nuts for a buttery crunch.",

    "ingredients": "Kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon (4g) baking soda\n4 pounds (about 2kg) russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into quarters, sixths, or eighths, depending on size (see note)\n5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, goose fat, or beef fat\nSmall handful picked rosemary leaves, finely chopped\n3 medium cloves garlic, minced\nFreshly ground black pepper\nSmall handful fresh parsley leaves, minced",
    "directions": "1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450°F/230°C (or 400°F/200°C if using convection). Heat 2 quarts (2L) water in a large pot over high heat until boiling. Add 2 tablespoons kosher salt (about 1 ounce; 25g), baking soda, and potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.\n\n2. Meanwhile, combine olive oil, duck fat, or beef fat with rosemary, garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately.\n\n3. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potato–like paste has built up on the potato chunks.\n\n4. Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.\n\n5. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.",

You can also use a mix of the two.\n\nThe potatoes should be cut into very large chunks, at least 2 to 3 inches or so. For medium-sized Yukon Golds, this means cutting them in half crosswise, then splitting each half again to make quarters. For larger Yukon Golds or russets, you can cut the potatoes into chunky sixths or eighths.",

    "directions": "In a 4-quart saucepan, bring water and 1/4 cup salt to a boil over high heat. While water comes to a boil, trim roots from leeks, taking care to leave base intact. Halve leeks lengthwise, stopping 1-inch above the base. Rinse leeks thoroughly under cool running water to remove any dirt between layers. Using kitchen twine, tie both halves of each leek about two-thirds of the way up to hold them together. Line a plate with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel; set aside.\n\nLower leeks into boiling water; reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, covered, until base of leek can be easily pierced with a paring knife, about 12 minutes. Using tongs or a spider skimmer, transfer leeks to a paper towel-lined plate, allowing excess water to drip off. Let rest at room temperature until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes.\n\nWhile leeks cool, place sherry vinegar and shallots in a medium bowl and let sit for 5 minutes. Whisk in whole-grain mustard, Dijon mustard, pepper, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Slowly stream in olive oil, whisking vigorously and constantly, until emulsified and creamy. Set vinaigrette aside.\n\nRemove twine from leeks. Completely halve leeks lengthwise, and arrange, cut side down, on paper towel-lined plate. Place paper towels on top of leeks, and gently press down on leeks to remove any excess water.\n\nSpread half (40 ml) of the vinaigrette evenly over platter. Arrange leeks, cut side up, on platter; drizzle with remaining vinaigrette. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs, parsley, and capers.",

Add orange, lemon, and lime slices and maraschino cherries.\n\nServe immediately over ice, or refrigerate 8 hours to overnight for best flavor.\n\nFor a fizzy sangria, add club soda just before serving.",
    "description": "Any dry red wine will work, but we like to use fruity Spanish wine, such as Garnacha for the best flavor results. It doesn't have to be the most expensive bottle either. You'll be adding so many sweet ingredients to the wine that will dress it up.\n\nWe like to use what this recipe calls for (lemon, orange, lime, and maraschino cherries), but you can really use any in-season fruits that you like.",
    "notes": "You can use add ginger ale instead of club soda if preferred.\n\nMade 2022-06-24 -- did not have all the orange juice or the lemonade concentrate, but still very good.\n",

    "ingredients": "Tinga:\n2 pounds boneless pork butt , trimmed of excess fat and cut into 1-inch pieces (see note)\n2 medium onions , 1 quartered and 1 chopped fine\n5 medium garlic cloves , 3 peeled and smashed and 2 minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\n4 sprigs fresh thyme\nTable salt\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon dried oregano\n1 (14.5-ounce) can tomato sauce\n1 tablespoon ground chipotle powder (see note)\n2 bay leaves\n\nTostadas:\n3/4 cup vegetable oil\n12 (6-inch) corn tortillas (see note)\nTable salt\n\nGarnishes:\nQueso fresco or feta cheese\nFresh cilantro leaves\nSour cream\nDiced avocado\nLime wedges",
    "directions": "1. FOR THE TINGA: Bring pork, quartered onion, smashed garlic cloves, thyme, 1 teaspoon salt, and 6 cups water to simmer in large saucepan over medium-high heat, skimming off any foam that rises to surface. Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and cook until pork is tender, 75 to 90 minutes. Drain pork, reserving 1 cup cooking liquid. Discard onion, garlic, and thyme. Return pork to saucepan and, using potato masher, mash until shredded into rough ½-inch pieces (see Step-by-Step below); set aside.\n\n2. Heat olive oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add shredded pork, chopped onion, and oregano; cook, stirring often, until pork is well browned and crisp, 7 to 10 minutes. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\n\n3. Stir in tomato sauce, chipotle powder, reserved pork cooking liquid, and bay leaves; simmer until almost all liquid has evaporated, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove and discard bay leaves and season with salt to taste.\n\n4. TO FRY TOSTADAS: Heat vegetable oil in 8-inch heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat to 350 degrees. Using fork, poke center of each tortilla 3 or 4 times (to prevent puffing and allow for even cooking). Fry 1 at a time, holding metal potato masher in upright position on top of tortilla to keep it submerged (see photo below), until crisp and lightly browned, 45 to 60 seconds (no flipping is necessary). Drain on paper towel-lined plate and season with salt to taste. Repeat with remaining tortillas.\n\n5. TO SERVE: Spoon small amount of shredded pork onto center of each tostada and serve, passing garnishes separately.",

    "name": "Hoisin-glazed Grilled Chicken Legs with Napa Cabbage Slaw",
    "ingredients": "1/2 head Napa cabbage small, halved through the core end, tough core removed, and cut crosswise into 1/8-inch strips (about 4 cups) \n1 medium red bell pepper stemmed, seeded, and cut into thin strips \n4 tablespoons rice vinegar \n2 tablespoons soy sauce \n3 teaspoons fresh ginger minced \n1/4 cups vegetable oil \n1/3 cups hoisin sauce \n1 tablespoons Asian chile paste \n1/4 teaspoons Chinese five-spice powder \n4 whole chicken legs trimmed of overhanging fat and skin \n",
    "directions": "Light a large chimney starter filled with charcoal and allow it to burn until all the charcoal is covered with a layer of fine gray ash. Build a two-level fire by stacking most of the coals on one side of the grill and arranging the remaining coals in a single layer on the other side of the grill. Set the cooking rack in place, cover the grill with the lid, and let the rack heat, about 5 minutes. Use a wire brush to scrape clean the cooking grate. The grill is ready when the temperature of the stacked coals is medium-hot and that of the remaining coals is medium-low.\n\nMeanwhile, toss the cabbage and bell pepper in a large bowl and set aside. For the dressing, whisk together 2 tablespoons vinegar, 1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger, and the oil in a medium bowl until smooth. For the hoisin glaze, mix the remaining 2 tablespoons vinegar, remaining 1/2 tablespoon soy sauce, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons ginger in a small bowl with the hoisin sauce, chili paste, and five-spice powder.\n\nCook the chicken, uncovered, over the hotter part of the grill until seared, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Move the chicken to the cooler part of the grill; continue to grill, uncovered, turning occasionally, until dark and fully cooked, 12 to 16 minutes. To test for doneness, either peek into the thickest part of the chicken with the tip of a small knife (you should see no redness near the bone) or check the internal temperature at the thickest part with an instant-read thermometer, which should register 165 degrees.\n\nDuring the last 2 minutes of cooking, brush the chicken with the hoisin glaze. Cook about 1 minute, turn the chicken over, brush it again, and cook 1 minute more. Transfer the chicken to a serving platter. Rewhisk the dressing and toss with the cabbage. Serve the chicken immediately, with the slaw passed separately at the table.\n\n",

    "ingredients": "\n\n",
    "directions": "FOR THE TOPPING: Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Put the potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with water, and bring to a boil. Once the boiling reduces to a simmer, cook until the potatoes are tender and a fork inserted into the center meets little resistance, 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nDrain the potatoes well and return them to the saucepan over low heat. Mash the potatoes thoroughly with a potato masher. Fold in the butter until melted, then stir in the warm milk and egg yolks. Season with salt and pepper to taste, cover, and set aside while preparing the filling.\n\nFOR THE FILLING: Meanwhile, cook the lamb in a 12-inch ovenproof skillet over medium heat, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until no longer pink and the fat has rendered, about 3 minutes. Drain the lamb through a fine-mesh strainer, discarding all but 1 tablespoon of the rendered fat.\n\nHeat the 1 tablespoon reserved lamb fat in the skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the onion, carrots, and 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook until the vegetables are softened, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the flour and tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until the flour is incorporated, about 1 minute.\n\nSlowly stir in the broth, thyme, and Worcestershire sauce, scrape up the browned bits, and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until the sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nOff the heat, stir in the drained lamb and peas, season with salt and pepper to taste, and smooth the filling into an even layer. Dollop the potato topping evenly over the filling, then spread it into an even layer, covering the filling completely and anchoring the potatoes to the sides of the skillet. Bake the pie until the top is golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Let the pie cool for 10 minutes before serving.\n\n",

    "name": "Greek-Style Lamb Pita Sandwiches with Tzatziki Sauce—Gyros",
    "ingredients": "**For Tzatziki Sauce:**\n1 cup plain whole-milk yogurt\n½ medium cucumber, peeled, seeded, and diced fine (about 1/2 cup)\n⅜ teaspoon table salt\n1 tablespoon juice from 1 lemon\n1 small garlic clove, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 1/2 teaspoon)\n1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint leaves or dill\n\n**For Lamb Patties**\n4 (8-inch) pita breads (see note above)\n½ medium onion, chopped coarse (about 3/4 cup)\n4 teaspoons fresh lemon juice\n½ teaspoon table salt\n¼ teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon minced fresh oregano leaves\n2 medium garlic cloves, minced or pressed through a garlic press (about 2 teaspoons)\n1 pound ground lamb\n2 teaspoons vegetable oil\n\n**Accompaniments**\n1 large tomato, sliced thin\n2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce\n2 ounces crumbled feta cheese (about 1/2 cup)",
    "directions": "**BEFORE YOU BEGIN**\n\nSince the yogurt and cucumbers in the Tzatziki Sauce need to drain for 30 minutes, start making the sauce before the patties. Although we prefer the richness of plain whole-milk yogurt, low-fat yogurt can be substituted. Greek yogurt can also be substituted, but use 1/2 cup and skip the step of draining. While we didn’t like the flavor of dried mint, dried dill may be used in place of fresh, but reduce the amount to 1/2 teaspoon. \n\nFor the patties, the test kitchen prefers the flavor of fresh oregano, but 1 teaspoon of dried can be substituted. The skillet may appear crowded when you begin cooking the patties, but they will shrink slightly as they cook. \n\nIf using pocketless pitas (see illustrations below for folding instructions), heat them in a single layer on a baking sheet in a 350-degree oven for 5 minutes. Do not cut top quarters off pocketless pitas; instead, use a portion of a fifth pita to create crumbs in step 1. \n\nWhen cooking the patties, use a splatter screen to keep the mess to a minimum. The patties can be prepared through step 1 and refrigerated for up to a day or frozen before cooking as directed in step 2 (frozen patties should be thawed in refrigerator prior to cooking). This recipe can be doubled.\n\n**For the Tzatziki Sauce:** Line fine-mesh strainer set over deep container or bowl with 3 paper coffee filters or triple layer of paper towels. Spoon yogurt into lined strainer, cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, combine cucumber, 1/8 teaspoon salt, and lemon juice in colander set over bowl and let stand 30 minutes.\n\nDiscard drained liquid from yogurt. Combine thickened yogurt, drained cucumber, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt, garlic, and mint in clean bowl.\n\n**For the Patties:** Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Cut top quarter off each pita bread. Tear quarters into 1-inch pieces. (_You should have 3/4 cup pita pieces._) Stack pitas and tightly wrap with aluminum foil. Process onion, lemon juice, salt, pepper, oregano, garlic, and pita bread pieces in food processor until smooth paste forms, about 30 seconds. Transfer onion mixture to large bowl; add lamb and gently mix with hands until thoroughly combined. Divide mixture into 12 equal pieces and roll into balls. Gently flatten balls into round disks, about 1/2 inch thick and 2 1/2 inches in diameter.\n\nPlace foil-wrapped pitas directly on oven rack and heat for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add patties and cook until well browned and crust forms, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip patties, reduce heat to medium, and cook until well browned and crust forms on second side, about 5 minutes longer. (See below for tips on flipping patties.) Transfer patties to paper towel-lined plate.\n\nUsing soupspoon, spread 1/4 cup Tzatziki Sauce inside each pita. Divide patties evenly among pitas; top each sandwich with tomato slices, 1/2 cup shredded lettuce, and 2 tablespoons feta. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\n\nFor a home-style lamb sandwich recipe that would give us the same flavors and textures as restaurant gyros, even if they didn't have the traditional appearance, we pan-fried ground lamb patties flavored with oregano, onion, and minced garlic. To make the patties juicier, we added a panade (a paste of fresh bread crumbs and milk), substituting pita crumbs for the traditional bread crumbs. For readers who can’t easily find ground lamb, we developed a ground beef version of our lamb sandwich recipe.",

    "directions": "Position two racks near the center of the oven and heat the oven to 425°F. Heat a 10- to 11-inch heavy, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat. Generously season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper. Pour 1 Tbs. of the oil into the hot skillet and swirl to coat. Arrange the chicken thighs skin side down in the pan and cook until the skin is golden brown, about 7 min. Turn the chicken over. If a lot of fat has accumulated, carefully spoon it off and discard.\n\nWhile the chicken browns, toss the beans, tomatoes, onion, olives, and garlic in a large bowl with the remaining 2 Tbs. oil. Season with 3/4 tsp. salt and several grinds of pepper and spread the vegetables on a rimmed baking sheet.\n\nPut the skillet of chicken and the baking sheet with the vegetables in the oven, with the chicken on the higher rack. Roast the chicken until a thermometer inserted in the center of a thigh registers 170°F, 18 to 20 min. Continue to roast the vegetables until very soft and beginning to brown, 8 to 12 min. more.\n\nMeanwhile, remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the chicken to a plate. Spoon off and discard as much fat as possible from the chicken juices, add the wine, set over high heat, and boil until reduced to about 1/4 cup sauce, 4 to 6 min.; it should be syrupy and concentrated in flavor. Swirl in the butter, if using.\n\nRemove the vegetables from the oven and toss them with the basil. Divide the vegetables among four plates. Arrange one or two chicken thighs on the vegetables and drizzle with the pan sauce. Serve immediately.",

    "ingredients": "4 teaspoons vegetable oil\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n1 tablespoon chili-garlic sauce\n1 teaspoon sugar\n½ teaspoon cornstarch\n8 small heads baby bok choy (1 1/2 to 2 ounces each), halved, washed thoroughly, and spun dry\n2 tablespoons water",
    "directions": "1. Combine 1 teaspoon oil and garlic in small bowl; set aside. Whisk soy sauce, chili-garlic sauce, sugar, and cornstarch together in second small bowl; set aside.\n\n2. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add bok choy and water and immediately cover. Cook, covered, shaking pan occasionally, for 2 minutes. Remove lid, toss bok choy, and then push bok choy to sides of skillet. Add garlic mixture to center and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Stir garlic mixture into bok choy and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until all water has evaporated, stems are crisp-tender, and leaves are wilted, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add soy sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and coats bok choy, about 15 seconds. Transfer to platter and serve.",
    "description": "When preparing baby bok choy, two main issues arise: cleaning the notoriously dirty vegetables and getting the stalks to achieve a perfectly tender-crisp texture before the leaves get too limp. Unlike mature bok choy, which is often chopped into small pieces for cooking, part of the allure of baby bok choy is showcasing its diminutive size. In this recipe, we struck a balance by cutting the bok choy in half lengthwise; this provided access to the areas where most of the dirt and grit typically hide so we could thoroughly clean them, and it helped the vegetables cook more evenly than if they were left whole. An initial stint of steaming gave the stems the head start they needed to soften slightly before sautéing. A mixture of soy and chili-garlic sauces formed the base of a salty and mildly spicy sauce. ",
    "notes": "If using heads larger than 2 ounces each, quarter them instead of halving. We spin the bok choy dry after washing to avoid adding too much water to the pan.\n",

    "directions": "Add dried chiles to a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven or stock pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until slightly darkened with intense, roasted aroma, 2 to 5 minutes. Do not allow to smoke. Remove chiles to a 2 quart microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl, set aside. (Alternatively, place dried chiles on a microwave-safe plate and microwave on high power in 15-second increments until pliable and toasted-smelling, about 30 seconds total. Transfer to a 2-quart microwave-safe liquid measuring cup or bowl.) Add half of chicken broth and chipotle chiles and their sauce, cover with plastic wrap, and microwave on high power until gently simmering, about 5 minutes. Remove from microwave and set aside for 5 minutes. Transfer chiles and liquid to blender and blend, starting on the lowest possible setting and gradually increasing speed to high (make sure to hold the lid down with a clean kitchen towel or a potholder to prevent it from blowing out). Blend until smooth, about 1 minute.\n\nSeason beef cubes generously with salt and pepper. Heat oil in the base of a Dutch oven over high heat until just starting to smoke. Add half of the beef cubes in a single layer and cook until deeply browned on a single side, about 3 minutes. Remove from pot, set aside with remaining unseared beef.\n\nReturn Dutch oven to medium-high heat. Add onion and cook, stirring frequently until translucent and softened, about 2 minutes. Add garlic, and if using, cinnamon, cumin, allspice, and oregano, and cook, stirring constantly until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add all meat (seared and non-seared) and accumulated juices back to pan along with chile purée, stir to combine.\n\nBring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Cover, leaving lid just barely ajar, and cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is completely tender, about 3 hours. (Check sauce levels occasionally; if sauce gets too thick, add 1/4 cup water or stock until desired consistency is reached). Once sauce has thickened to desired consistency, cover completely for the remainder of cook time. Alternatively, chili can be cooked in a 200° to 250°F (95° to 120°C) oven with the lid of the Dutch oven slightly ajar.\n\nStir in optional fish sauce, and vinegar. Season to taste with salt and hot sauce. For best results, allow chili to cool and store in the refrigerator at least overnight and up to 5 days. Reheat the next day to serve.\n\nServe, garnished with cilantro, chopped onions, scallions, grated cheese, avocado, and warm tortillas as desired.",

    "directions": "Thawed berries shed a lot of flavorful liquid that must be reduced to a syrup on the stovetop before baking. While the blueberries are baking, prepare the ingredients for the biscuit topping, but do not stir the wet into the dry ingredients until just before the berries come out of the oven. A standard or deep-dish 9-inch pie pan works well; an 8-inch-square baking dish can also be used. Vanilla ice cream or lightly sweetened whipped cream is the perfect accompaniment. To reheat leftovers, put the cobbler in a 350-degree oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until heated through.\n\nThaw frozen blueberries in colander set over bowl to catch juices. Transfer juices (you should have about 1 cup) to small saucepan; simmer over medium heat until syrupy and thick enough to coat back of spoon, about 10 minutes.\n\nAdjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees.\n\nFOR THE FILLING: Stir sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt together in large bowl. Add berries, with syrup, and mix gently with rubber spatula until evenly coated; add lemon zest and juice and mix to combine. Transfer berry mixture to 9-inch glass pie pan, place pie pan on rimmed baking sheet, and bake until filling is hot and bubbling around edges, about 30 minutes.\n\nFOR THE BISCUIT TOPPING: Whisk flour, cornmeal, 1/4 cup sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in large bowl to combine. Whisk melted butter, buttermilk, and vanilla in small bowl. Mix remaining 2 teaspoons sugar and cinnamon in second small bowl and set aside. One minute before berries come out of the oven, add wet ingredients to dry ingredients; stir with rubber spatula until just combined and no dry pockets remain.\n\nTO ASSEMBLE AND BAKE COBBLER: Remove berries from oven; increase oven temperature to 425 degrees. Pinch off 8 equal-sized pieces biscuit dough and place on hot berry filling, spacing them at least 1/2 inch apart (they should not touch). Sprinkle each mound of dough with cinnamon-sugar. Bake until filling is bubbling and biscuits are golden brown on top and cooked through, 20 to 22 minutes. Cool cobbler on wire rack 20 minutes and serve.",

    "directions": "Rinse chickpeas and place in a large bowl. Cover with cold water, adding enough to allow the chickpeas to at least triple in volume. Cover and let stand at room temperature overnight. The next day, drain, rinse, and carefully dry chickpeas in a salad spinner.\n\nCombine chickpeas, herbs, scallions, garlic, cumin, coriander, and salt in the work bowl of a food processor. Pulse until chickpeas are very finely minced, stopping the food processor to scrape down the sides as necessary. A handful of the mixture squeezed into a ball should be able to barely hold together. If not, process a little more.\n\nTransfer mixture to a bowl, cover, and place in refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow time for more starch to seep out of chickpeas. This will help the balls retain their shape better once formed. Using a tablespoon measure, scoop out heaping spoonfuls of the mixture into your hand. Gently shape each into a ball (you will not be able to roll the mixture like cookie dough; this is okay) and place them on a clean plate.\n\nWhen all the balls have been formed, fill a deep cast iron, carbon steel, or nonstick skillet or Dutch oven with 3/4 inch of oil. Heat over high heat until oil registers 375°F (190°C) on an instant-read thermometer. Carefully lower chickpea balls into oil one at a time, allowing a little space between each ball and cooking in batches if necessary. Adjust heat as necessary to maintain a temperature of between 350 and 375°F (175 and 190°C). Allow to cook undisturbed until well browned on bottom sides, then carefully flip balls with a fork until browned on second side, about 4 minutes total. Transfer cooked chickpea balls to a paper towel–lined plate and season with salt. Repeat with remaining chickpea balls.\n\nServe immediately with tahini and/or hummus on the side, or stuffed into pita bread with tahini, tomatoes, cucumber, pickles, and shredded cabbage.",

    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Pulse bread and melted butter in food processor until coarsely ground, about 12 pulses. Spread crumbs in even layer on rimmed baking sheet and bake, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Let cool on wire rack. (Do not turn off oven.) Once crumbs have cooled slightly, break up any large clumps into fine crumbs.\n\nMeanwhile, bring 4 quarts water to boil in large pot. Stir in pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring often, until pasta is al dente. Drain pasta and leave in colander.\n\nWhisk ½ cup milk and cornstarch together in small bowl. Add remaining 4 tablespoons butter to now-empty pot and return to medium heat until melted. Stir in garlic, mustard, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Whisk in remaining 2 cups milk and chicken broth and bring to simmer. Whisk in cornstarch mixture, return to simmer, and continue cooking, whisking often, until large bubble form on surface and mixture is slightly thickened, 8 to 10 minutes. Off heat, gradually whisk in Colby and cheddar until completely melted. Season with salt and pepper to taste.\n\nStir drained pasta into cheese sauce, breaking up any clumps, until well combined. Pour pasta mixture into 8-inch square baking dish (or other 2-quart casserole dish) and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Bake until golden brown and bubbling around edges, about 15 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving.",
    "description": "Our favorite traditional baked mac and cheese relies on béchamel sauce for its base. This sauce, which calls for whisking milk into a butter-flour roux, ensures smooth, creamy results in the final dish. For equally creamy results without the flour, we relied on cornstarch (first mixed with milk to prevent clumping), which thickened our sauce to the perfect consistency. (We kept our sauce mixture loose so that it could withstand the heat of the oven without drying out.) For the cheese, we found that a mix of Colby cheese (for meltability) and cheddar cheese (for rich flavor) delivered an appealing casserole that baked up smooth and creamy. Adding a little dry mustard and cayenne helped to boost the cheesy flavor even more. Now, all we needed was the perfect bread-crumb topping. The simple fix was pulsing gluten-free bread and melted butter in the food processor and then toasting the coated crumbs in the oven. Once baked on top of our casserole, the crumbs provided the ideal crisp counterpoint to our tender pasta and creamy cheese sauce.",

    "ingredients": "8 large eggs\n4 scallions, sliced thin\n3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon minced fresh sage\nSalt and pepper\n2 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled (1/2 cup)\n3 tablespoons vegetable oil\n8 ounces cremini mushrooms, trimmed and sliced thin\n2 garlic cloves, sliced thin\n3 cups water\n6 ounces angel hair pasta, broken in half",
    "directions": "INSTRUCTIONS SERVES 4 TO 6\n\nTo ensure the proper texture, it’s important to use angel hair pasta for this recipe. We like to serve the frittata warm or at room temperature, with a side salad.\n\n1. Whisk eggs, scallions, olive oil, sage, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in large bowl until egg is even yellow color. Stir in Gorgonzola and set aside.\n\n2. Heat 2 teaspoons vegetable oil in 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add mushrooms and 1/8 teaspoon salt, cover, and cook until mushrooms release liquid, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook until liquid evaporates and mushrooms turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes longer. Stir in garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat. Transfer mushrooms to bowl with egg mixture and wipe out skillet.\n\n3. Bring water, pasta, remaining 7 teaspoons vegetable oil, and 3/4 teaspoon salt to boil in now-empty skillet over high heat, stirring occasionally. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, water has evaporated, and pasta starts to sizzle in oil, 8 to 12 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook pasta, swirling pan and scraping under edge of pasta with rubber spatula frequently (do not stir), until bottom turns golden and starts to crisp, 5 to 7 minutes.\n\n4. Using spatula, push some pasta up sides of skillet so entire pan surface is covered with pasta. Pour egg mixture over pasta. Using tongs, lift up loose strands of pasta to allow egg to flow toward pan, being careful not to pull up crispy bottom crust. Cover skillet and continue to cook over medium heat until bottom crust turns golden brown and top of frittata is just set (egg below very top will still be raw), 5 to 8 minutes. Slide frittata onto large plate. Invert frittata onto second large plate and slide it browned side up back into skillet. Tuck edges of frittata into skillet with rubber spatula. Continue to cook second side of frittata until light brown, 2 to 4 minutes longer.\n\n5. Remove skillet from heat and let stand for 5 minutes. Using your hand or pan lid, invert frittata onto cutting board. Cut into wedges and serve.\n\nPasta Frittata Made Without Leftovers\n\nThough it’s usually whipped up with last night’s noodles, pasta frittata can be just as simple using our from-scratch approach.\n\nUSE A SKILLET: Add water, broken angel hair, and oil to skillet—the only vessel you will need for this dish.\n\nCOOK OFF LIQUID: Once pasta is tender, keep cooking until water evaporates and pasta starts sizzling in oil.\n\nLET IT CRISP: After about 5 minutes, pasta will start to crisp (check progress by lifting up the edge).\n\nLIFT LOOSE STRANDS: Pour eggs over pasta, then gently pull up top strands to allow eggs to flow into center.\n\nSLIDE AND INVERT: To brown second side, slide frittata onto plate, invert onto second plate, and return to skillet.",

    "directions": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Cutting the carrots in our recipe into identically sized batons gave us evenly cooked results with the best browning. Precooking the carrots right on the baking sheet kept their moisture in and minimized withering. We buttered and seasoned the carrots, tightly covered the baking sheet with aluminum foil, and cooked them in a very hot oven. When the carrots were tender, we slid the uncovered baking sheet back into the oven and roasted them until the moisture had burned off and the roasted carrots took on nut-brown caramelized streaks. \n\n1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 425 degrees. In large bowl, combine carrots with butter, ½ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper; toss to coat. Transfer carrots to foil or parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and spread in single layer.\n\n2. Cover baking sheet tightly with foil and cook for 15 minutes. Remove foil and continue to cook, stirring twice, until carrots are well browned and tender, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to serving platter, season with salt and pepper to taste, and serve.",

Stir 2 cups stock into rice mixture; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until almost all liquid has been absorbed and rice is just al dente, 16 to 18 minutes, stirring twice during simmering.\n\nAdd ½ cup stock to risotto and stir gently and constantly until risotto becomes creamy, about 3 minutes. Stir in Parmesan and shrimp. Cover saucepan and let stand off heat for 5 minutes.\n\nGently stir chives, lemon zest and juice, and remaining 1 tablespoon butter into risotto. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If desired, stir in additional stock to loosen texture of risotto. Serve, passing lemon wedges and extra Parmesan separately.",

(Makes about 3/4 cup of dressing.)\n\n2 Toast the peanuts. Although the roasted peanuts from the store may already be cooked, you'll get even better flavor with just a little toasting. Heat a small skillet on medium high heat and add the nuts to the pan. Do not ignore or the nuts can easily burn. Stir a little with a wooden spoon until the peanuts begin to get browned in spots and you can smell the toasting aromas. Remove peanuts from pan to a dish.\n\n3 In a large bowl, toss the sliced cabbage, grated carrots, and peanuts together, and any other optional ingredients you care to add (like a little chopped cilantro or green onions).

    "ingredients": "3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breast halves, trimmed of excess fat and skin\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n3 medium jalapeño chiles\n3 poblano chiles (medium), stemmed, seeded, and cut into large pieces\n3 Anaheim chile peppers (medium), stemmed, seeded, and cut into large pieces\n2 medium onions, cut into large pieces (2 cups)\n6 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 2 tablespoons)\n1 tablespoon ground cumin\n1 ½ teaspoons ground coriander\n2 (14.5-ounce) cans cannellini beans, drained and rinsed\n3 cups low-sodium chicken broth\n3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 2 to 3 limes)\n¼ cup minced fresh cilantro leaves\n4 scallions, white and light green parts sliced thin",
    "directions": "Adjust the heat in this dish by adding the minced ribs and seeds from the jalapeño as directed in step 6. If Anaheim chiles cannot be found, add an additional poblano and jalapeño to the chili. This dish can also be successfully made by substituting chicken thighs for the chicken breasts. If using thighs, increase the cooking time in step 4 to about 40 minutes. Serve chili with sour cream, tortilla chips, and lime wedges.\n\n1. Season chicken liberally with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until just smoking. Add chicken, skin side down, and cook without moving until skin is golden brown, about 4 minutes. Using tongs, turn chicken and lightly brown on other side, about 2 minutes. Transfer chicken to plate; remove and discard skin.\n\n2. While chicken is browning, remove and discard ribs and seeds from 2 jalapeños; mince flesh. In food processor, process half of poblano chiles, Anaheim chiles, and onions until consistency of chunky salsa, ten to twelve 1-second pulses, scraping down sides of workbowl halfway through. Transfer mixture to medium bowl. Repeat with remaining poblano chiles, Anaheim chiles, and onions; combine with first batch (do not wash food processor blade or workbowl).\n\n3. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from Dutch oven (adding additional vegetable oil if necessary) and reduce heat to medium. Add minced jalapeños, chile-onion mixture, garlic, cumin, coriander, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, about 10 minutes. Remove pot from heat.\n\n4. Transfer 1 cup cooked vegetable mixture to now-empty food processor workbowl. Add 1 cup beans and 1 cup broth and process until smooth, about 20 seconds. Add vegetable-bean mixture, remaining 2 cups broth, and chicken breasts to Dutch oven and bring to boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, stirring occasionally, until chicken registers 160 degrees (175 degrees if using thighs) on instant-read thermometer, 15 to 20 minutes (40 minutes if using thighs).\n\n5. Using tongs, transfer chicken to large plate. Stir in remaining beans and continue to simmer, uncovered, until beans are heated through and chili has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes.\n\n6. Mince remaining jalapeño, reserving and mincing ribs and seeds (see note above), and set aside. When cool enough to handle, shred chicken into bite-sized pieces, discarding bones. Stir shredded chicken, lime juice, cilantro, scallions, and remaining minced jalapeño (with seeds if desired) into chili and return to simmer. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper and serve.",

    "directions": "For the Fajita Marinade: Combine soy sauce, lime juice, oil, brown sugar, cumin, black pepper, chili powder, and garlic in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Transfer 1/2 cup (120ml) marinade to a separate vessel and set aside.\n\nFor the Chicken: Place chicken in a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and add remaining marinade. Seal bag, squeezing out as much air as possible. Massage bag until meat is fully coated in marinade. Lay flat in refrigerator, turning every couple of hours, for at least 3 and up to 10 hours.\n\nFor the Fajitas: When ready to cook, preheat broiler and position over rack to highest position. If you have a baking steel or stone, set it on the top rack and allow to preheat. If using a baking steel/stone, set a rimmed baking sheet on it to preheat as well; otherwise leave baking sheet at room temperature.\n\nRemove chicken from marinade and blot dry with paper towels. Arrange chicken in an even layer on rimmed baking sheet. Broil, without flipping, until chicken is well browned on top side, about 5 minutes. Broiler strength and oven designs vary greatly, so cooking times will vary as well; keep a close watch. If your broiler heats unevenly, you may need to move the sheet tray around for more even browning. Flip chicken and broil until second side is also browned, about 4 minutes longer (chicken cooked with the help of a baking steel/stone will already have browned on the bottom, so you can flip it and continue cooking to ensure it's fully cooked through). \n\nRemove from oven and transfer chicken to a platter to rest.\n\nSwitch oven from broil mode to 450°F (230°C). Add red, yellow, and green bell peppers as well as onions to baking sheet. Pour reserved 1/2 cup of marinade all over and toss until evenly coated; using a wooden spoon, scrape up any browned bits on the baking sheet. Arrange peppers and onion in an even layer that covers the baking sheet from edge to edge, then cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender and browned in spots, about 25 minutes (if your oven heats from the top, you will want to cook the vegetables on a middle rack to avoid excessive scorching and burning). If you're using a baking steel/stone, you can cook the vegetables on it, but keep a closer eye since they run the risk of scorching on the bottom; if this begins to happen, move the sheet pan to another rack.\n\nSlice chicken into thin strips, then add back to sheet pan with any juices. Return to oven to warm through.\n\nServe immediately with hot tortillas, guacamole, pico de gallo, and other condiments, as desired.",

    "name": "Vietnamese Scallion Sauce",
    "ingredients": "½ cup chopped scallions (5 or 6 scallions; see note)\nKosher salt and ground black pepper\n¼ cup peanut or other neutral oil\n1½ tablespoons fish sauce or soy sauce\n1½ tablespoons finely grated fresh ginger\n1 teaspoon white sugar\n",
    "directions": "01 In a medium heatproof bowl, combine the scallions, ¼ teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Using your fingers, gently rub the salt and pepper into the scallions until the scallions begin to wilt.\n\n02 In a small saucepan over medium-high, heat the oil until shimmering, then pour the hot oil over the scallions; the scallions will sizzle. Stir, then stir in the fish sauce, ginger and sugar. Cool to room temperature.\n\n03 Seared and Steamed Asparagus: In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil until barely smoking. Add 1½ pounds asparagus (trimmed and halved on the diagonal) and cook, stirring only a few times, until charred. Add 3 tablespoons water, then immediately cover. Reduce to low and cook, stirring just once or twice, until the asparagus is crisp-tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve with scallion oil spooned over.\n\n04 Pan-Seared Shrimp: In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil until barely smoking. Add 1½ pounds extra-large (21/25 per pound) shrimp (peeled and deveined) in an even layer and cook without stirring until well brown, about 3 minutes. Stir the shrimp, then remove the pan from the heat and stir constantly, allowing the skillet’s residual heat to finish the cooking, until the shrimp are opaque throughout, another 20 to 30 seconds. Serve over steamed white rice and topped with scallion oil.\n\n05 Pan-Seared Skirt Steak: In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 1 tablespoon neutral oil until barely smoking. Add 1 pound beef skirt steak (trimmed and cut into 3- to 4-inch sections) and cook, until well browned on both sides, 5 to 7 minutes total, flipping once about halfway through. Transfer to a plate and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut the steak against the grain into thin slices. Drizzle with scallion oil.",

Stir in remaining 4 Tbls of sugar, 3/4 c of warm water, and the egg, milk, and salt. Add 4 c of the flour and stir to form a dough until smooth and elastic either by hand on a floured work surface, in a food processor, or in a mixer fitted with a dough hook; add more flour, if the dough is too sticky to work with. It should take 6-8 minutes.\n\nUse 1 1/2 tsp of the oil to lightly oil a large bowl. Place the dough in the bowl, brush the top with the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of oil, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let rise in a warm, draft-free spot until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1.5 hours. Punch down the dough and pinch off 2\" pieces. Roll them between your palms into smooth balls. You should have 14 to 16 balls. Place the balls on a lightly floured baking sheet and cover with a lightly dampened clean kitchen towel. Let rise again until puffy, about 30 minutes.\n\nSetup grill for direct grill and preheat to high\n\nLightly flour the cutting board, then roll out a dough ball on it to form a disk about 5\" in diameter. Gently slap the disk from one hand to the other to stretch it into an elongated 7 - 8 inch circle. Stretch circle into traditional tear drop shape and place on hot grill.\n\nCook the naan until the bottom is crust and browned and the top is puffed and blistered, 2-4 minutes. Brush the naan with butter, turn it over and grill the other side until lightly browned. Brush each naan with butter as it comes off the grill.\n\n",

    "name": "Thai Stir-Fried Pork with Basil, Chilies and Garlic (Pad Kraprao)",
    "ingredients": "7 medium garlic cloves, smashed and peeled\n4 or 5 Fresno chilies, stemmed, seeded and roughly chopped\n1 tablespoon oyster sauce\n1 tablespoon soy sauce\n1 tablespoon fish sauce\n1 tablespoon packed light brown sugar\n6 tablespoons grapeseed or other neutral oil, divided\n4 large eggs\n1 pound ground pork\n2 cups (1 ounce) lightly packed fresh holy basil or 3 cups (1½ ounces) lightly packed Thai or Italian basil, torn\nSteamed jasmine rice, to serve",
    "directions": "01 In a food processor, combine the garlic and chilies. Pulse until finely chopped, with some slightly larger pieces remaining, 8 to 10 pulses. In a small bowl, whisk together the oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, sugar and ½ cup water. Set both the garlic-chili mixture and the sauce mixture near the stove.\n\n02 In a 12- to 14-inch wok over medium-high, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil until barely smoking. Reduce to medium, then crack 2 eggs into the center of the wok, each in a different spot. Use a silicone spatula to gently push the edges of the egg whites toward the yolks to try to keep the eggs separate (it’s fine if the whites touch in spots). Cook, occasionally spooning some of the hot oil over them, until the whites are fully set and the edges are crisp and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula, transfer the eggs to a paper towel-lined plate. Using 2 tablespoons of the remaining oil, cook the remaining eggs the same way; set the eggs aside. Wipe out the wok.\n\n03 Return the wok to medium-high and heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until barely smoking. Add the garlic-chili mixture and cook, stirring, until fragrant and lightly browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the pork and cook, stirring, until the meat is broken up into mostly small bits, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sauce mixture and cook, stirring, until the pork is no longer pink and the liquid thickens slightly but remains saucy, about 3 minutes. Off heat, add the basil and stir until just wilted.\n\n04 Divide the rice and the stir-fry among serving plates and top each portion with an egg.\n\n05 SKILLET INSTRUCTIONS: Follow the recipe to process the garlic and chilies and combine the sauce mixture. In a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat 4 tablespoons of the oil until barely smoking. One at a time, crack the eggs into the skillet, each in a different spot, then use a silicone spatula to gently push the edges of the egg whites toward the yolks to try to keep the eggs separate (it’s fine if the whites touch in spots). Cook, occasionally spooning some of the hot oil over, until the whites are fully set and the edges are crisp and browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a thin metal spatula, transfer the eggs to a paper towel-lined plate; set aside. Wipe out the skillet, return it to medium-high and heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering. Add the garlic-chili mixture and cook, stirring, until fragrant and lightly browned, 45 to 60 seconds. Add the pork and cook, stirring, until broken up into mostly small bits, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the sauce mixture and cook, stirring, until the pork is no longer pink and the liquid thickens slightly but remains saucy, about 3 minutes. Off heat, add the basil and stir until just wilted.

    "ingredients": "¼ cup white sugar\n4 tablespoons coconut water or water, divided\n3 tablespoons fish sauce\n2 Fresno or serrano chilies, stemmed and sliced into thin rings\n1 stalk lemon grass, trimmed to the lower 5 or 6 inches, bruised\n2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh ginger\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into 1½-inch pieces\n1 tablespoon lime juice\n2 scallions, thinly sliced on the diagonal\n",
    "directions": "In a 12-inch skillet, combine the sugar and 2 tablespoons of the coconut water. Cook over medium-high, occasionally swirling the pan to help the sugar dissolve and to encourage even browning, until the caramel is mahogany in color and smokes lightly, 4 to 6 minutes.\n\nRemove the pan from the heat and add the fish sauce along with the remaining 2 tablespoons coconut water; the mixture will bubble vigorously and the caramel will harden in spots. Bring to a simmer over medium and cook, stirring, until the hardened bits have dissolved. Add the chilies, lemon grass, ginger and pepper, then cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Increase to medium-high and stir in the chicken. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reduces and clings to the chicken, 10 to 14 minutes.\n\nRemove from the heat, then discard the lemongrass. Stir in the lime juice. Transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with the scallions.",

    "ingredients": "3 pounds russet potatoes Yukon Gold potatoes, or white potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/16 to 1/8 inch thick \n5 tablespoons unsalted butter melted \n1/4 cups vegetable oil  or peanut oil, plus additional for greasing cookie sheet \n",
    "directions": "1. Toss potato slices with melted butter in large bowl until potatoes are evenly coated. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 450 degrees. \n\n2. Pour oil into 10-inch heavy-bottomed ovenproof nonstick skillet; swirl to coat pan bottom and set skillet over medium-low heat. Begin timing, and arrange potato slices in skillet, starting in center (see illustrations 1 and 2 below) to form first layer. Sprinkle evenly with scant 1/4 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper to taste. Arrange second layer of potatoes, working in opposite direction of first layer (see illustration 3); sprinkle evenly with scant 1/4 teaspoon salt and ground black pepper. Repeat, layering potatoes in opposite directions and sprinkling with salt and pepper, until no slices remain (broken or uneven slices can be pieced together to form a single slice; potatoes will mound in center of skillet); continue to cook over medium-low heat until 30 minutes elapse from the time you began arranging potatoes in skillet. \n\n3. Using bottom of 9-inch cake pan, press potatoes down firmly to compact. Cover skillet and place in oven. Bake until potatoes begin to soften, about 15 minutes. Uncover and continue to bake until potatoes are tender when paring knife is inserted in center and edge of potatoes near skillet is browned, about 10 minutes longer. Meanwhile, line rimless cookie sheet or back of baking sheet with foil and coat very lightly with oil. Drain off excess fat from potatoes by pressing potatoes into skillet with bottom of cake pan while tilting skillet to pour off fat (see illustration 4). \n\n4. Set foil-lined cookie sheet on top of skillet. With hands protected by oven mitts or pot-holders, hold cookie sheet in place with one hand and carefully invert skillet and cookie sheet together (see illustration 5). Remove skillet. Carefully slide potatoes onto platter (see illustration 6); cut into wedges and serve immediately.\n\n",
    "description": null,
    "notes": "Do not slice the potatoes until you are ready to start assembling. Remember to start timing when you begin arranging the potatoes in the skilletno matter how quickly you arrange them, they will need 30 minutes on the stovetop to brown properly.",

    "name": "Roasted Mushroom Pizza with Fontina and Scallions",
    "ingredients": "1 pound portobello mushroom caps\n1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil\nTable salt and ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh thyme\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n1 portion pizza dough (warmed to 75°F)\nBread flour, for dusting countertop\n1 tablespoon semolina flour, for dusting pizza peel\n1 cup Fontina-Parmesan cream [recipe:Fontina and Parmesean Cream For Pizza]\n2 scallions, thinly sliced on bias\n1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes",
    "directions": "At least 1 hour before baking, heat the oven to 550°F with a baking steel or stone on the upper-middle rack and a second rack in the lower-middle.\n\nUsing a spoon, scrape off and discard the gills on the undersides of the mushroom caps. Halve any caps that are 5 inches or larger in diameter, then cut the caps into ¼-inch slices. In a large bowl, toss the mushrooms, olive oil and ¼ teaspoon salt.\n\nSpread the mushrooms in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast on the lower oven rack, stirring once, until they have released their moisture, the moisture evaporates and the mushrooms begin to brown, about 15 minutes. Stir in the thyme and garlic, then roast until the mushrooms have browned and the garlic is no longer raw, another 3 to 4 minutes. Let cool completely on a wire rack. Leave the oven on.\n\nTurn the dough out onto a counter dusted generously with bread flour. Flour your hands and, using your fingers, press the dough, starting at the center and working out to the edges, into a 12-inch round, turning the dough over once. The round should be thin in the center, with slightly thicker edges. Lightly dust a baking peel, inverted baking sheet or rimless cookie sheet with the semolina. Transfer the dough to the peel and, if needed, reshape into a 12-inch round.\n\nUsing the back of a spoon, spread the fontina-Parmesan cream evenly on the dough, leaving ½-inch border at the edge. Scatter the mushrooms over it and season with pepper. Slide the pizza onto the baking steel or stone and bake until the crust is well browned, 7 to 9 minutes.\n\nUsing the peel, transfer the pizza to a wire rack. Let cool for a couple of minutes, then sprinkle with scallions and red pepper flakes.",

    "directions": "Warm the black bean and sweet potato mixtures in separate saucepans. Wrap tortillas in foil and warm in a 300 degree F oven, or heat each tortilla on both sides quickly in a heavy skillet over medium heat. In each tortilla place about 1/2 cup black beans and 1/2 cup sweet potatoes. Fold one side of the tortilla over the filling and then fold in both sides, and roll up into a burrito. Place on a plate and top with generous spoonfuls of salsa, guacamole and sour cream.\n\nVariation: You may fold grilled chicken, steak, or any other grilled meat into the burrito as well.\n\nBlack Beans -----------------\nIn a heavy saucepan, combine beans, onions, garlic, olive oil and water. Bring to a boil and simmer approximately 1 1/2 hours. Add the tomatoes and wine and season with salt and pepper. Simmer another 30 minutes or until beans are very tender. Using a wooden spoon or potato masher, mash the beans slightly. Leave some beans whole. This mixture should mound softly and be moist but not watery. Adjust by cooking longer or by adding water.\n\nFlying Burrito Mashed Sweet Potatoes ---------------------\n\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees F.\n\nWash the sweet potatoes but leave the skins on. Rub with olive oil and bake until very tender, about 45 minutes. Cool the potatoes until they can be handled and remove skins. Place in a heavy saucepan and add the remaining ingredients. Mash the mixture well, taste for seasoning, reheat, and serve.\n\nThis mixture makes an excellent side dish as well as a burrito filling. It can be prepared while the black beans simmer.\n\nYield: 5 cups",

    "description": "Savory pork meatballs and jasmine rice give this Thai soup heft, but its aromatic broth—made with plenty of shallots, garlic, lemon grass and ginger—has excellent flavor on its own. The soup is a sort of blank canvas for garnishes; the recipe calls for our favorites, but feel free to offer only those that appeal to you. The fried shallots, however, are a must.",

Whisk vinegar, garlic, mayonnaise, ¼ teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in nonreactive bowl until mixture appears milky and no lumps remain. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle in oil. (Dressing should appear homogeneous, glossy, and slightly thickened, without pools of oil on surface.)\n\n3. Gently toss avocados, 2 tablespoons dressing, and ½ teaspoon salt in bowl. Transfer avocados to large platter or individual plates.\n\n4. Toss shallot, tomatoes, radishes, and basil with remaining dressing. Spoon tomato mixture over avocados and sprinkle with ricotta salata. Serve immediately.",
    "description": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS\nButtery avocados demand an acidic dressing to cut their richness. We were able to emulsify a highly acidic vinaigrette with a bit of mayonnaise to ensure cling. To add textural contrast, we steered clear of leafy greens and relied on crunchier vegetables and juicy fruits. Arranging the dressed avocado chunks below the other ingredients maximized visual appeal by preventing the avocado from turning the salad murky.\n",

    "directions": "1. FOR THE SPINACH SAUCE: Place spinach in large microwave-safe bowl, cover, and microwave until wilted, about 3 minutes. When cool enough to handle, chop enough spinach to measure 1/3 cup and set aside. Transfer remaining spinach to blender and wipe out bowl. Place mustard greens in now-empty bowl, cover, and microwave until wilted, about 4 minutes. When cool enough to handle, chop enough mustard greens to measure 1/3 cup and transfer to bowl with chopped spinach. Transfer remaining mustard greens to blender.\n\n2. Meanwhile, melt butter in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds, coriander, paprika, cardamom, and cinnamon and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add onion and ¾ teaspoon salt; cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic, ginger, and jalapeño; cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned and just beginning to stick to pan, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomatoes and cook mixture until pan is dry and tomatoes are beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove skillet from heat.\n\n3. Transfer half of onion mixture to blender with greens. Add half of cashews and water; process until smooth, about 1 minute. Return puree to skillet.\n\n4. Return skillet to medium-high heat, stir in chopped greens and buttermilk, and bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until flavors have blended, 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Gently fold in cheese cubes and cook until just heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to serving dish, sprinkle with remaining cashews and cilantro, and serve.",

    "notes": "WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS: Paneer, the fresh cheese called for in this Indian recipe, is available in some specialty markets, but it couldn't be more simple to make a home with whole milk and buttermilk. For a spinach sauce with great flavor, we combine spinach and mustard greens and spice them up with onion, garlic, ginger and jalapeño, plus some chopped tomatoes. Pureeing some cashews into the sauce adds richness and body.",

    "directions": "Preheat the grill over medium-high direct heat. Oil the grill grates. Finely chop the cilantro and scallion and mix in the oil and ginger. Season with salt and pepper.\n\nCut two 3-inch long slits through the skin lengthwise on the bottom of the salmon fillets, going about halfway into the salmon. Evenly stuff the slits with the herb mixture. Season the fish with salt and pepper.\n\nStir together the lime juice, soy and honey until smooth. Place the salmon, skin side up, on the grill and cook until well marked, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the salmon and continue to cook, brushing the tops with the sauce, until the fish is cooked through, about another 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a serving plate and sprinkle the tops with the sesame seeds. Serve with edamame and lime wedges.\n\nBroiler directions: Position an oven rack so that a baking sheet set on the rack is about 4-inches below the heat source. Preheat the broiler. Prepare the salmon as above and place the fillets, skin down, on a foil lined baking sheet coated with cooking spray. Broil, basting 3 to 4 times with the sauce, until just cooked through, about 6 to 7 minutes.\n",

    "directions": "Heat a smoker to 290°F. Or set up covered charcoal or wood grill with indirect heat and wood chips.\n\nRemove and discard the sheer white membrane from the underside of the ribs. The layer will be slippery, so grab it with a kitchen towel to pull it off. Pat the ribs dry, then generously season both sides with salt and coarsely ground black pepper, patting the seasoning into the meat. Slide the ribs onto a wire rack and put in the smoker or on the grill away from the heat. You can also lay the slabs on the smoker or grill rack away from the heat. Smoke the ribs until tender or about 3 ½ hours. Continue to maintain a consistent temperature of 290ºF.\n\nWhile the ribs are smoking, whisk the honey and beer in a small bowl until blended. After about 1 hour of cooking the ribs, when juices start to bead up on the surface, **brush the ribs with the honey mixture and rotate the slabs for an even cooking.** After the second hour of cooking, flip the ribs over and baste with the honey mixture again. **Continue turning and basting every 30 minutes** until the meat is tender, takes on a reddish tint and starts to pull away from the bones.\n\nRemove the ribs from the smoker or grill and let them rest at room temperature until warm, at least 20 minutes.\n\nAdd wood or charcoal to the fire to bring the temperature up to medium; you will finish the ribs over direct medium heat.\n\nTo make the chile-lime butter use a blender to create a pureed mix with the garlic, lime zest and juice, scallions, cilantro, Chile paste, melted butter, and one teaspoon salt. Blend for at least two minutes.\n\nCut and separate the ribs into single-bone pieces and toss the pieces in the chile-lime butter puree.\n\nGrill the ribs again over the hot side of the grill just until they start to char, about 4 minutes per side.\n\nToss the ribs in the chile-lime butter and serve hot.",

    "directions": "Sous Vide Temperature 150°F/65.5°C\n\nSous Vide Time 1½ to 3 hours\n\nActive Cooking Time 50 minutes, plus marinating time\n\n1. Process arbols, shallot, oil, salt, tomato paste, sugar, paprika, five-spice powder, garlic powder, lemon zest and juice, pepper, cayenne, and bay leaves in blender until smooth, scraping down sides of blender jar as needed, about 1 minute. Place chicken and chile paste in 1-gallon zipper-lock freezer bag and toss to coat. Seal bag, pressing out as much air as possible. Refrigerate chicken for at least 6 hours or up to 24 hours.\n\n2. Using sous vide circulator, bring water to 150°F/65.5°C in 7-quart container. Gently lower bag into prepared water bath until chicken is fully submerged, and then clip top corner of bag to side of water bath container, allowing remaining air bubbles to rise to top of bag. Reopen 1 corner of zipper, release remaining air bubbles, and reseal bag. Cover and cook chicken for at least 1½ hours or up to 3 hours.\n\n3. Adjust oven rack 6 inches from broiler element and heat broiler. Set wire rack in aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet and spray with vegetable oil spray. Transfer chicken skin side up to prepared rack and let rest while preparing sauce.\n\n4. Pour accumulated juices into 8-inch skillet, bring to simmer over medium heat, and cook until reduced by two-thirds, 3 to 5 minutes. Brush chicken with sauce and broil until skin is crisp and lightly charred, 6 to 8 minutes. Serve with lemon wedges.\n\nTO MAKE AHEAD: Chicken and accumulated juices can be rapidly chilled in ice bath and then refrigerated in zipper-lock bag after step 2 for up to 5 days. To reheat, return sealed bag to water bath set to 150°F/65.5 °C for 20 minutes. Proceed with step 3.",
    "description": "\n",
    "notes": "Why This Recipe Works\n\nFor our rendition of peri peri chicken, we start by blending garlic powder, tomato paste, herbs, spices, lemon juice, and dried arbol chiles to make a thick paste. We throw the paste straight into a plastic bag with the chicken to first marinate and then circulate. (Marinating is key to give the salt time to penetrate the meat to both season it and help it retain moisture during cooking.) Because there is little to no evaporation due to the sealed bag, this cooking method produces a considerable amount of juices. We reduce the juices in a pan to intensify the flavors, and then we brush them over the chicken before giving the meat a final broil in the oven to brown the skin.",

    "directions": "Combine the marinade ingredients\n\nDry chicken well before putting in marinade. Place them into the bowl of marinade. Coat each piece thoroughly, then set aside for about 30 minutes. For maximum penetration of the flavor into the chicken, keep the meat-side down facing the marinade (as opposed to the skin side which wouldn't absorb the marinade. \n\nWhen they’ve finished marinating, spread an even layer of cornstarch (3 tbsp) on a plate, and coat each side of the thighs with a thin layer of cornstarch. Gently shake off excess cornstarch.\n\nHeat a skillet or flat-bottomed wok on high heat. Once it’s hot, add oil (2 tbsp).\nWhen the oil’s shimmering, turn the heat to medium-low, and place each piece of the chicken skin-side down. Cook until golden brown, or about 2-3 minutes.\n\nFlip the chicken over and cook the other side until it’s also golden brown, or about 5-6 minutes.\nWhen both sides are beautifully golden brown, flip all the pieces back to the skin side and cook for another 1-2 minutes to make it crispy.\n\nSeason chicken with garlic powder and a little salt, remove from pan.\nAdd 1 tsp oil. Add the minced garlic to the now-vacated middle of the pan, and cook until fragrant, or 10 seconds. Add the sliced onion and spread it out in the pan as you cook until that’s also fragrant, or 20 seconds.\n\nPour cooking wine (1 tbsp) into the pan and immediately cover with the lid. Turn the heat to high to reduce the sauce down. Cook covered like this for just 30-40 seconds.\n\nSprinkle with garlic powder and a little salt. Plate your creation by creating a bed of onions on the bottom, perching the chicken thighs on top, and decorating with the most beautiful pieces of onion on top.",

Transfer solids to small bowl and cool; set oil and solids aside.\n\nFollowing illustrations below, butterfly chicken, flatten breastbone, and tuck wings behind back. Using hands or handle of wooden spoon, loosen skin over breast and thighs and remove any excess fat. Combine 1 tablespoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper in small bowl. Mix 3 teaspoons salt mixture with cooled garlic solids. Spread salt-garlic mixture evenly under skin over chicken breast and thighs. Sprinkle remaining teaspoon salt mixture on exposed meat of bone side. Place chicken skin-side up on wire rack set in rimmed baking sheet and refrigerate 1 to 2 hours.\n\nTurn all burners to high. Wrap 2 bricks tightly in aluminum foil and place bricks on cooking grate. Heat with lid down until very hot, about 15 minutes. Scrape cooking grate clean. Leave primary burner on high and turn off other burner(s).\n\nPlace chicken skin-side down over cooler side of grill with legs facing fire, place hot bricks lengthwise over each breast half, cover grill, and cook until skin is lightly browned and faint grill marks appear, 22 to 25 minutes. Remove bricks from chicken. Using tongs or towel, grip legs and flip chicken (chicken should release freely from grill; use thin metal spatula to loosen if stuck), skin-side up, with breast facing the cool part of the grill. Place bricks over breast, cover grill, and cook until chicken is well browned, 12 to 15 minutes.\n\nRemove bricks, flip chicken skin-side down over hot grates, and cook until chicken skin is well crisped and instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes, moving chicken as necessary to prevent flare-ups. Transfer chicken to cutting board and let rest 10 minutes. Whisk lemon juice and remaining thyme and rosemary into reserved oil; season with salt and pepper.

    "description": null,
    "notes": "For the best flavor, use a high-quality chicken, such as Bell & Evans. Use an oven mitt or dish towel to safely grip and maneuver the hot bricks. If youre using table salt, reduce the amount to 1½ teaspoons in step 2. You will need two standard-sized bricks for this recipe. Placing the bricks on the chicken while it cooks ensures that the skin will be evenly browned and well rendereddont skip this step. A cast-iron skillet or other heavy pan can be used in place of the bricks.",

Add ancho mixture and chipotle; cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nAdd remaining 2 cups water, beans and their liquid, sugar, and tomato puree. Bring to boil, scraping bottom of pot to loosen any browned bits. Cover, transfer to oven, and cook until meat is tender and chili is slightly thickened, 1 1/2 to 2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.\n\nRemove chili from oven and let stand, uncovered, for 10 minutes. Stir in any fat that has risen to top of chili, then add vinegar and season with salt to taste. Serve, passing lime wedges, cilantro, and chopped onion separately. (Chili can be made up to 3 days in advance.)",

    "directions": "Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).\n\nRoll out refrigerated pie crust and line a 9- or 10-inch pie or quiche plate. Prick dough all over with the tines of a fork and crimp the edges between your thumb and forefinger so they form a pattern along the top edge of the plate. Place a piece of aluminum foil into tart shell and weight with pie weights, uncooked rice, or dried beans. Prebake shell until crisp, 10 to 12 minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions and sprinkle with salt. Cook, stirring, until onions are wilted and translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until onions have softened completely and are lightly caramelized, another 20 minutes.

    "directions": "**For the Chicken Broth:**\nUsing a sharp knife, cut chicken breasts from breastbone and detach legs (drumstick with leg attached) from carcass. In a 7-quart pot or Dutch oven, combine the detached chicken breasts, legs, chicken carcass, celery, carrots, black peppercorns, bay leaves, salt, and water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat and cook uncovered until chicken breasts register 160℉ (71ºC) with a digital thermometer, about 35 minutes, skimming any scum that rises to the surface.\n\nUsing tongs, remove chicken breasts and transfer to a cutting board. Continue simmering the chicken legs until the thighs and drumsticks are cooked and register 175℉ (80ºC) on an instant-read thermometer, another 15 minutes. Using tongs, remove thighs and drumsticks and transfer to cutting board. Simmer broth with remaining carcass until slightly reduced and broth develops a rich flavor, about 25 minutes. Remove from heat and let broth cool slightly, about 15 minutes.\n\nUsing tongs, remove chicken carcass and transfer to cutting board with breast and legs and let cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain broth into a large bowl or heat-proof container and discard solids; measure out 6 cups broth and set aside. Wipe pot clean. Cool and reserve the remaining broth for another use. (See notes.)\n\nUsing 2 large forks, shred breast, thigh, and drumstick meat, and any remaining meat from the chicken carcass into bite-size pieces. Transfer shredded meat to a bowl and discard bones and skin.\n\n**For the Soup: **\nIn now-empty pot or Dutch oven, melt butter over medium heat. Once melted, add onion, carrot, celery, thyme, and garlic. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables soften, 7 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with flour; cook, stirring constantly, until vegetables are evenly coated and flour begins to stick to the bottom of the pot, 1 to 2 minutes.\n\nWhisk in the chicken stock, evaporated milk, salt, and Worcestershire sauce; bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until mixture thickens, about 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper as needed. Reduce heat to low to maintain a simmer while preparing the dumplings.\n\nFor the Dumplings: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, pepper, and thyme. Using a flexible spatula, incorporate sour cream, butter, and milk, stirring until fully combined. (Avoid over-mixing, which will result in tough dumplings.)\n\nStir the shredded chicken into the soup. Using 2 large spoons, work quickly to gently drop golf ball–size portions of dumpling dough into simmering soup; you should have about 15 dumplings. Some dumplings may dissolve slightly into the soup. This is OK as it will further thicken the soup. Cover and gently simmer until dumplings are fluffy, cooked through, and have doubled in size, about 10 minutes. Top with parsley and serve.",

    "name": "Chicken Saltimbocca",
    "ingredients": "1/2 cups all-purpose flour \nblack pepper \n8 chicken cutlets boneless, skinless (about 2 lbs.) \n1 tablespoons fresh sage minced (plus 8 extra leaves, optional) \n8 prosciutto thinly sliced, cut into 5- to 6-inch-long pieces to match chicken (about 3 ounces) \n4 tablespoons olive oil \n1 1/4 cups dry vermouth or white wine \n2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice \n4 tablespoons unsalted butter cut into 4 pieces and chilled \n1 tablespoons fresh parsley minced \ntable salt \n",
    "directions": "Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 200 degrees. Combine flour and 1 teaspoon pepper in shallow dish.\n\nPat cutlets dry with paper towels. Dredge chicken in flour, shaking off any excess. Lay cutlets flat and sprinkle evenly with minced sage. Place 1 prosciutto slice on top of each cutlet, pressing lightly to adhere; set aside.\n\nHeat 2 tablespoons oil in 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until beginning to shimmer. Add sage leaves (if using) and cook until leaves begin to change color and are fragrant, about 15 to 20 seconds. Using slotted spoon, remove sage to paper towel-lined plate; reserve. Add half of cutlets to pan, prosciutto-side down, and cook until light golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook on other side until light golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Transfer to wire rack set on rimmed baking sheet and keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and cutlets, then transfer to oven to keep warm while preparing sauce.\n\nPour off excess fat from skillet. Stir in vermouth, scraping up any browned bits, and simmer until reduced to about 1/3 cup, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in lemon juice. Turn heat to low and whisk in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Off heat, stir in parsley and season with salt and pepper. Remove chicken from oven and place on platter. Spoon sauce over cutlets before serving.\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP\n\nSaltimbocca Made Simple\n\nFLOUR CHICKEN ONLY\n\nNo need to flour the prosciutto before sautéing, just the chicken.\n\nSPREAD SAGE FLAVOR\n\nSprinkling the cutlets with sage and topping with prosciutto distributes flavor evenly.\n\nFORGET THE TOOTHPICK\n\nSearing the cutlets prosciutto-side down first helps the ham stick.\n\nMAKE SAUCE\n\nStir the vermouth into the pan, reduce, and finish with butter. Spoon over cutlets.\n\n",

Proceed immediately to next step, or for best results, marinate for about 30 minutes or up to 2 days.\n\nPreheat a broiler (toaster oven or regular oven) to high. Cover a small broiler pan with aluminum foil. Rub excess marinade off of salmon and place on broiler pan. Broil until top surface is well charred and salmon is barely warm in the center, about 5 minutes, using the foil to protect any areas that threaten to burn. Serve immediately.",
